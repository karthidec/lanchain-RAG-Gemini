## What They Don't Teach You at Harvard Business School

MARK MCCORMACK ,  who Sports  Illustrated called  'the  most  powerful man in sport', founded IMG (International Management Group) on a handshake.  It  was  the  world's  first  sports  management  company, representing golfers such as Arnold Palmer, Jack Nicklaus and Gary Player. Today  it  is the world's largest sports and  lifestyle management company, marketing the likes of Tiger Woods, Michael Schumacher, Serena Williams, Kiri te Kanawa and Elizabeth Hurley.

IMG now has 3000 employees and operates out of 85 offices in 33 countries.  Its  businesses  now  include  the  world's  largest  licensing agency, a prominent literary agency, an agency that manages worldrenowned  classical artists and  three international modelling agencies. Its broadcast division, Trans World International (TWI), is the  world's  largest  independent  producer  and  distributor  of  sports programming.

Mark McCormack, who died in May 2003, never attended Harvard Business School, but the success of his company has been taught there as a case study.

## What They Can't Teach You At Harvard Business School

When  I  was  at  Yale  Law  School  I  was  told  that  as  a  business education,  a  law  degree  was  every  bit  as  valuable  as  an  MBA (Master of Business Administration). Years later, having lectured at Harvard  and  a  number  of  other  business  schools,  I  became convinced that it  was  -  though  both  have  definite  limitations  when applied to the real world. As an introduction to business, an MBA or an LLB - is a worthwhile endeavour. But as an education, as part of an ongoing learning process, it is at best a foundation and at worst a naive form of arrogance.

The  best  lesson  anyone  can  learn  from  business  school  is  an awareness  of  what  it  can't  teach  you  -  all  the  ins  and  outs  of everyday business life. Those ins and outs are largely a self-learning process, though the experience of someone like myself might make the learning shorter, easier, and a lot less painful.

In  the  early  1960s  I  founded  a  company  with  less  than  $500  in capital  and  thereby  gave  birth  to  an  industry  -  the  sports management  and  sports  marketing  industry.  Today,  that  company has  grown  into  the  International  Management  Group  (IMG),  with offices  around  the  world  and  several  hundred  million  dollars  in annual revenues.

I am probably better known as 'the guy who made Arnold Palmer all those millions' than I am by my own name. In truth, Arnold Palmer made Arnold Palmer 'all those millions', though I think Arnold would agree that I helped.

While  the  management  of  celebrity  sports  figures  will  always  be very important to us - with Jean-Claude Killy, Jackie Stewart, Björn

Borg, Herschel Walker, Martina Navratilova, Chris Evert and dozens of  others  among  our  list  of  more  than  500  clients  -  it  is  only  one aspect of what I do, personally, and what we do as an organization.

Our  television  division  produces  hundreds  of  hours  of  original network  programming  throughout  the  world  and  sells  thousands more  hours  for  such  clients  as  Wimbledon,  the  National  Football League,  the  US  Tennis  and  Golf  Associations,  the  World  Ski Federation,  the  National  Collegiate  Athletics  Association  and  the Royal  and  Ancient  Golf  Club.  Our  marketing  consulting  division  is retained all over the world by more than fifty blue chip corporations. We do the personal financial planning and management for several hundred  high-level  corporate  executives.  We  own  three  fashion agencies and we represent, or have represented, entities as diverse as  the  Nobel  Foundation,  the  Vatican  and  the  English  Catholic Church,  and  we  are  television  consultants  for  the  Organizing Committees  for  the  1988  Calgary  Winter  Olympics  and  the  1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, Korea.

In  more  than  twenty  years,  I  suspect  I  have  encountered  every type  of  business  situation  and  every  type  of  business  personality imaginable.  I  have  had  to  cipher  the  complex  egos  of  superstar athletes  -  and  of  their  spouses,  parents,  lovers,  neighbours  and camp  followers.  I  have  dealt  with  heads  of  state  and  heads  of corporations,  with  international  bankers  and  small-town  advisers, with  bureaucratic  governing  sports  bodies  and  autocratic  empire builders. I have come in contact with every phase and facet of the entertainment,  communication  and  leisure-time  industries.  And  at one  time  or  another  I  have  done  business  with  practically  every nationality on the face of the earth.

What I haven't experienced myself I have observed. Because of our  affiliations  with  major  companies  throughout  the  world  I  have been in  countless  executive  suites  and  board-rooms  where  I  have witnessed a lot of companies in action - and have realized why a lot of  them  are  incapable  in  action.  I  have  seen  every  conceivable corporate  style,  culture,  theory  and  philosophy  put  to  work  -  and noted  why  a  lot  of  them  never  do.  From  my  experiences  and observations I have drawn the advice in this book covering selling,

negotiating,  starting,  building  and  running  a  business,  managing people and personalities, getting ahead and getting things done.

But  in  a  way  this  categoric  breakdown  is  misleading,  because what this book is really about is 'street smarts' - the ability to make active, positive use of your instincts, insights and perceptions. To use them to get where you want to go, preferably by the shortest route, even if this means jumping some fences or going through a few back alleys.

Can you really learn to apply gut reactions to business? Perhaps not  totally,  but  what  you  can  learn  are  the  results  of  street-smart thinking. Much of what I say and do in business, from a self-effacing comment  to  an  intentionally  provocative  one,  is  designed  to  give myself a slight psychological edge over others, or to help me get the most out of others. That is what street smarts really is - an applied people sense.

Whether it is  a  matter  of  closing  a  deal  or  asking  for  a  raise,  of motivating a salesforce of 5000 or negotiating one-to-one, of buying a  new  company  or  turning  around  an  old  one,  business  situations almost  always  come  down  to  people  situations.  And  it  is  those executives with a finely  tuned  people  sense,  and  an  awareness  of how to apply it, who invariably take the edge.

In fairness to Harvard Business School, what they don't teach you is what they can't teach you, which is how to read people and how to use that knowledge to get what you want.

Yet  that  is  exactly  what  this  book can teach  you  -  how  to  read people, how to influence their reading of you, and how to apply or customize both to any likely business situation.

Business  situations,  of  course,  are  just  that  -  situational.  But whenever possible - whenever a definite conscious act will generate a consistent subconscious response - I have also done the reading for  you.  Based  on  my  own  experiences  and  observations  I  have recommended  many  specific  techniques  which  can  be  directly applied with immediate and tangible results.

Much of this advice is unconventional, not just to be different, but because I believe the dependence on conventional wisdom - on old ideas  and  antiquated  methods  -  is  the  biggest  problem  with American business today. Running a company is a constant process

of breaking out of systems and challenging conditioned reflexes, of rubbing against the grain. People want to work but policies suffocate them,  and  it  would  be  impossible  to  write  a  responsive  book  that didn't address this problem, and the many disguises it wears.

Business  demands  innovation.  There  is  a  constant  need  to  feel around the fringes, to test  the  edges,  but  business  schools,  out  of necessity,  are  condemned  to  teach  the  past.  This  not  only perpetuates conventional thinking; it stifles innovation. I once heard someone say that if Thomas Edison had gone to business school we would all be reading by larger candles.

My main purpose in writing this book is to fill in many of the gaps the  gaps  between  a  business  school  education  and  the  street knowledge that comes from the day-to-day experience of running a business and managing people.

Over  the  years,  we  have  hired  many  MBAs  from  Harvard  and elsewhere to work for us. In fact, in my more impressionable days, I guess this was one of my own conditioned reflexes: if you have a problem, hire an MBA. As we grew and got to areas in which we had less  confidence  or  expertise,  I  reasoned  that,  by  virtue  of  their education, the MBAs were the best people to run these areas for us.

What I discovered was that a Masters in business can sometimes block  an  ability  to  master  experience.  Many  of  the  early  MBAs  we hired  were  either  congenitally  naive  or  victims  of  their  business training.  The  result  was  a  kind  of  real-life  learning  disability  -  a failure  to  read  people  properly  or  to  size  up  situations  and  an uncanny knack for forming the wrong perceptions.

In  fairness  to  some  of  our  employees,  we  do  have  a  number  of MBAs  working  for  us  who  have  made  the  adjustment  to  the  real world  quite  nicely.  But  to  assume,  as  I  once  did,  that  advanced degrees or high IQ scores automatically equal 'business smarts' has often proved an expensive error in judgement.

A number of years ago Harvard Business School did a case study on  the  problem.  Even  in  phrasing  their  questions  the  students struggled to find the appropriate business-school cubbyhole in which to place every conceivable business situation. Then, as if by turning a  crank,  they  expected  the  appropriate  solution  to  pop  out.

Obviously, neither people nor problems fit moulds, and the very act of trying to make them do so distorts perceptions.

Two old friends once met on the street after not seeing each other for twenty-five years. One, who had graduated at the top of his class, was now working as an assistant branch manager of the local bank. The  other,  who  had  never  overwhelmed  anyone  with  his  intellect, owned his  own  company  and  was  now  a  millionaire  several  times over. When his banking friend asked him the secret of his success, he said it was really quite simple. 'I have this one product that I buy for  two  dollars  and  sell  for  five  dollars,'  he  said.  'It's  amazing  how much money you can make on a three per cent markup.'

I do not have an innate prejudice against intellect, intelligence or, for  that  matter,  graduate  degrees,  but  they  are  not  substitutes  for common sense, people sense and street smarts. I suspect Harvard Business School recognizes this as well. I would like nothing more than to see this book become required reading there.

Part One People

## Reading People

Let me tell you two stories. One involves a future president, the other a  high-living  golf  pro,  and  though  the  incidents  happened  nearly  a decade apart they are linked in my mind.

In 1963, I was in Paris for the World Cup golf tournament, where I happened to have two chance meetings with Richard Nixon - once at the golf club when he came by my table to speak to Gary Player; the  other,  only  a  few  days  later,  at  the  Tour  d'Argent,  when  he stopped to speak to Arnold Palmer and Jack Nicklaus, with whom I was having dinner.

Nixon's remarks were pleasant enough. What stayed with me was that on both occasions he used the same words, the exact same five or  six  sentences.  It  was  as  though  he  were  talking  to  stick  figures rather than to real people, as though he had a fund of stock phrases for every type of person he was likely to meet - five or six sentences for a sports personality, a paragraph for a business leader, another for a religious figure.

The other incident involved the flamboyant golfer, Doug Sanders. When we first started representing Doug a lot of people told me we had made a mistake. Doug did have some 'Vegas' in him. He ran with a fast crowd, got into his share of scrapes, and was known to make more than  just  a  friendly  wager  every  now  and  then.  Some people  thought  he  was  too  controversial  for  us  and  asked  why  I trusted  him.  Quite  frankly,  I  trusted  Doug  Sanders  a  lot  more  than some of the people who were questioning me. Which brings me to my story.

Once Doug played a golf exhibition up in Canada. He made all the arrangements  himself.  I  didn't  know  anything  about  it,  and  since apparently he was paid in cash I probably never would have known anything about it. But about a week after the exhibition took place we

received an envelope from Doug. There was no letter or note inside, only our commission - in cash.

I recall these incidents now because they demonstrate something important about reading people. What people say and do in the most innocent situations can speak volumes about their real selves.

My  accidental  encounters  with  Nixon,  for  instance,  indicated  a certain insincerity and a degree of phoniness that I remembered ten years  later,  when  he  was  forced  to  resign  the  Presidency.  Nixon's troubles probably had as much to do with his phoniness as they did with  Watergate.  People  don't  like  phoneys.  They  don't  trust  them, and they certainly don't want one running their country.

In  Doug  Sanders's  case,  the  fee  for  the  exhibition  was  so insignificant it  might not have seemed worth the bother. But to this day I can see Doug going back to his hotel room, pulling a wad of cash out of his pocket, counting out our commission, sticking it in an envelope,  and  scribbling  out  our  address.  This  was  so  totally  in keeping with Doug Sanders's character that nothing else would have occurred to him.

One would like to believe that it was a future American president who exhibited quality of character, and a golf hustler who came off as a con man. But the facts in these cases belie those conclusions.

What does this have to do with business? Everything.

In  the  business  world  it  is  easy  enough  to  adopt  a  corporate persona, or several corporate personae, depending on the situation. Some people will act one way with their subordinates, another way with their boss, and a totally different way with people outside their company.

But the real self - one's true nature - can't change colour to suit its environment. In any ongoing business situation, sooner or later either subliminally or out in the open - you are going to find that you are dealing with that person's real self.

If nothing else, you want to hear what people are really saying, as opposed  to  what  they  are  telling  you;  you  want  to  be  able  to  put someone's  deeds  -  his  own  business  activities  -  into  the  larger context  of  character.  Whether  I'm  selling  or  buying;  whether  I'm hiring  or  (in  our  capacity  as  consultants)  being  hired;  whether  I'm negotiating a contract or responding to someone else's demands, I

want to know where the other person is coming from. I want to know the other person's real self.

Business situations always come down to people situations. And the more - and the sooner - I know about the person I am dealing with, the more effective I'm going to be.

## Don't Take Notions For An Answer

People  will  often  make  judgements  about  others  even  before meeting them, based on what they've heard or what they know about their company.  They  will  even  mistrust  or  ignore  their  own perceptions so as to make them conform to conclusions that have already been reached.

At IMG we often have to face the preconceived notions that exist about our own company. What we do is fairly visible, and a number of  the  magazine  and  television  profiles  about  IMG  or  me  stressed our power position in sports, and painted us as tough, even ruthless, negotiators.

Nine out of ten times this works to our advantage. People expect us to name big numbers and their anticipation often makes it easier for  us  to  get  them.  And  when  they  find  that  we  are  actually  fairly reasonable people to deal with, they are bowled over.

But there is also every tenth guy who has so hardened himself to his preconceived notions that he has no perception of the business situation itself, or of the people from our company with whom he is dealing. He is so prepared to be tough himself, or to defend against our toughness, that he takes 'Nice to meet you' as a veiled threat. Obviously,  his  preconceived  notions  have  made  him  incapable  of any genuinely revealing insights.

People-reading is a matter of opening up your senses to what is really going on and converting this insight into tangible evidence that can be used to your advantage.

Dave  DeBusschere,  the  former  basketball  star,  was  a  vicepresident  of  our  television  company  for  several  years  prior  to  his assuming his present position as General Manager of the New York Knicks.  Dave  once  had  several  frustrating  meetings  with  an

executive  of  an  insurance  company  in  Connecticut  whom  he  was trying  to  interest  in  sponsoring  one  of  our  television  shows.  The executive  seemed genuinely interested  in  the  concept,  but  was  so overwhelmed to be dealing with Dave DeBusschere he could never get  past  this  fact,  or  his  own  suspicions.  If  this  was  such  a  great opportunity, he reasoned, then how come just a 'regular guy' wasn't trying to sell it to him?

## Use Your Insight

Dave Marr, the former PGA golf champion, and I were once joking about  some  of  the  great  golf  hustlers  we  had  known  when  Dave came  up  with  the  First  Axiom  of  Golf  Wagering:  'Never  bet  with anyone you meet on the first tee,' he said, 'who has a deep suntan, a one-iron in his bag, and squinty eyes.'

Shrewd  insights  into  people  can  be  gained  simply  through  the powers of observation. In most business situations there is usually more to see than meets the eye, a whole level of personal dynamics operating just beneath the surface.

Most business situations provide all sorts of tangible evidence that allows  you  to  see  beneath  the  surface.  Sometimes  these  are  the things  that  people  say  and  do  unconsciously,  the  way  someone looks  away at the sound of a particular question, for instance. But they may also be acts that are neither simple or unconscious, such as  the  way  someone  chooses  to  phrase  a  particular  thought.  The point is that the clues for insight abound, and are there to be used by anyone who is tuned in to them.

A  surprising  number  of  executives  are  not.  They  totally  lack  an awareness of what is really going on around them. Either they are too  busy  listening  to  themselves  to  listen  to  anyone  else,  or  too involved  in  their  own  corporate  presence  to  notice  what  someone else might be doing.

I  can't imagine anyone being effective in business without having some insight into people. Business itself is such a subtle matter of taking  a  slight  edge  here,  an  imperceptible  edge  there.  And  every aspect  of  the  process  comes  back  to  people  -  managing  them,

selling  to  them,  working  with  them,  simply  getting  them  to  do  what you want them to do. Without insight there is no subtlety.

Insight allows you to see beyond the present. Suppose you had a way  of  knowing  everything  that  was  going  to  happen  in  business over the next ten years. That information would not only make you wise; it would also make you successful and wealthy. Yet it is your insight into people that gives you the ability to predict the future.

A person's true nature, true self, cannot change with situations. It is totally consistent. The better you know that person, the more you can get beneath the façades, the more accurately you can predict how he or she is likely to react or respond in almost any business situation. This knowledge can be invaluable.

The  process,  of  course,  is  precisely  the modus  operandi of  the 'professionals'  -  the  psychics  and  fortune  tellers  who  have  been using the same tricks to tell the future for centuries.

Psychics will size up their clients by observing them - how they act,  how  they  look,  what  they're  wearing  -  and  by  asking  a  few innocent  questions.  From  this  information  they  can  'see  into  the future', which is really a matter of telling their client what he or she wants to hear based on what has already been found out. The good ones can come up with some startlingly perceptive things based on the tiniest pieces of information. There are probably some psychics who would make excellent business executives.

I also know a lot of business executives who would make terrible psychics.

Insight demands opening up your senses. I believe you can learn almost everything you need to know - and more than other people would like you to know - simply by watching and listening, keeping your eyes peeled, your ears open. And your mouth closed.

## Listen Aggressively

The ability to listen, really to hear what someone is saying, has far greater business implications, of course, than simply gaining insight into  people.  In  selling,  for  instance,  there  is  probably  no  greater asset. But the bottom line is that almost any business situation will

be handled differently, and with different results, by someone who is listening and someone who isn't.

When I was preparing to write this book I asked a number of my business  friends,  several  of  them  chairmen  of  companies,  what business  advice  they  would  give  if  they  were  writing  it.  Almost without exception, and often at the top of their lists, they said, 'Learn to be a good listener.'

One friend, the head of a well-known sales organization, described it  as  'Watch  your  listen/talk  ratio.'  Another,  an  executive  at  Pepsi Cola  told  me  the  story  of  one  of  Pepsi's  all-time  corporate  coups, and  how  if  he  had  been  a  better  listener  he  would  have  saved himself and his company a lot of time.

Pepsi,  he  said,  had  been  trying  for  ever  to  get  into  Burger  King and, since they believed Burger King would never dream of dropping Coke, the focus of their presentation was always towards giving the consumer  a  choice.  Burger  King's  philosophy  did  indeed  promote choice ('Have it your way'), but, as Pepsi was told time and again, this  was in the larger, quality control philosophy of a limited menu, including one cola.

One day, Pepsi finally got the hint and changed its pitch to stress that Pepsi and Burger King were corporate soul mates - the number twos going after the number ones. Since they already shared mutual strategies of 'product superiority', wouldn't it make sense to kick out Coke and bring in Pepsi?

'You know?' someone at Burger King said, 'we've been trying to tell you that for months. I'm glad someone finally listened.'

## Observe Aggressively

I  will  often  fly  great  distances  to  meet  someone  face-to-face,  even when I can say much of what needs to be said over the phone. If it's important,  or  if  it's  a  relationship  that  may  be  long-term,  I  want  to form impressions based on what I observe even more than on what I hear.  After  all,  the  impression  you  have  from  meeting  someone  in person is often quite different from that formed in speaking over the phone.

Observation is an aggressive act. People are constantly revealing themselves  in  ways  that  will  go  unnoticed  unless  you  are aggressively involved in noticing them.

The  statements  people  make  about  themselves,  or  the  signals they give off, are both conscious and unconscious. 'Body language', as  these  unconscious  signals  are  commonly  called,  is  certainly important, but it isn't even half the story. Most visual statements are quite conscious and intentional - the way someone dresses, the way he carries himself, and all the other ways people go about trying to create a particular impression. But these signals are only as useful as your ability to pick them up.

Aggressive observation means going after the big picture, taking all  these  conscious  and  unconscious  signals,  weighing  them,  and converting  them  into  usable  perceptions.  When  I  meet  someone face-to-face, what I am trying to establish more than anything else is a comfort zone - the 'picture frame' so to speak - or the boundaries I need  to  observe,  based  on  what  I  see  and  hear,  which  will  best enable me to deal with that person.

Aggressive  observation  does  not  mean  hasty  observation  jumping too quickly to conclusions, over-responding to conventional interpretations,  or  reading  meaning  into  things  where  none  exists. For  instance,  when  I  am  meeting  at  someone  else's  office  I  have often  noticed  that  people  will  sort  of  'lean  in'  to  the  situation  when they are ready to get serious, even unconsciously using their hands to  push  everything  on  their  desk  a  couple  of  inches  forward.  Yet almost as often I have seen people at this same point lean back in their chairs and feign a totally relaxed position.

To  generalize  about  either,  then,  or  to  jump  to  some  hasty conclusion,  would  be  as  foolish  as  it  would  be  misleading.  Almost any useful observation must be considered within the larger context of the situation, and what else you are hearing and seeing.

Conventional wisdom says that, if someone slumps in the chair, he or she is not very 'commanding'; the converse also supposedly holds true. But how many of us have, at one time or another, dealt with the 'glad hander', the guy who sits erect on the edge of his chair, leans slightly  forward,  hangs  on  your  every  word  -  and  then  never  does anything.  These  are  often  the  old  school  'I'm-glad-you-asked-me-

that'  types  or  the  too-eager  beavers,  the  young  fast-trackers  who have already decided that it is not what they do and say, but how they look along the way that is going to get them to the top. People who are a little too erect, a little too attentive, make me nervous.

Posture  is  also  interesting  for  another  reason.  One  of  the  most useful  observations  you  can  make  about  people  is  the  relative importance  they  place  on  form  in  relation  to  substance.  There's  a world of difference between posture and postur ing.

It bothers me when people strike a pose, when their casualness is a little too studied, or their efforts to bulk up their physique or suck in their stomach are a little too strained. The offices of these people, or how they choose to decorate them, are often an extension of this. An office  that  is  overly  cluttered  with  diplomas  and  mementos  or  is obviously contrived to create a certain impression is usually a dead giveaway. You have to be careful in dealing with people of this sort. They are more likely to be interested in looks than in performance, in appearances rather than real accomplishment.

Of  course,  the  most  fertile,  consistent,  revealing  arena  for observation are the eyes. The eyes will tell you more than anything else what someone is really thinking, even when all the other signs are pointing elsewhere.

Remember that people communicate with their eyes in business situations  when  they  can't  use  words.  The  next  time  you're  in  a meeting  with  more  than  one  person  from  outside  your  company, notice  their  eye  contact  with  each  other.  It  will  help  you  determine what  they  are  really  thinking,  reveal  who  among  them  is  most influential - and let you know whether you are boring them to tears.

## Ergo Ego

Ego  makes  the  difference  -  the  difference  between  theory  and practice,  between  wishful  thinking  and  real  life,  between  the  way things work and the way you would like them to work, between what they can teach you at Harvard Business School and what they can't. In a company of 2500 people there are 2500 egos running around, each with his or her unique view of reality. Ego is why some things

that should happen don't, why other things that shouldn't happen do, and why both take a lot longer than necessary.

A person's ego, even an overbearing one, may be your strongest ally. A lot of deals get made simply because someone's ego was so involved that he could not psychologically afford not to get it done. If you can read ego, understand its impact on business events, then control it by either stroking it, poking at it or minimizing its damage, you can be the beneficiary of many of these deals.

The size of someone's ego is by far the easiest thing to figure out about him. Most successful businessmen are one giant ego with a couple  of  arms  and  legs  sticking  out.  (Interestingly,  and  as  a generalization,  most  women  in  business  are  somewhat  harder  to read. Even today a woman's sense of self - how she defines herself - is less wrapped up in her job than is that of her male counterparts.)

But a giant ego doesn't mean a strong ego. In fact, it often means the opposite, that someone feels the need to be assertive because of  a  low  self-image.  And  a  small  ego  doesn't  necessarily  indicate weakness. Many of the most effective people I know in business are very low-key.

I  prefer  to  deal  with  strong  egos,  as  I'm  sure  most  people  in business  do.  These  are  usually  the  executives  who  are  willing  to take reasonable risks, don't second guess, and are the quickest to get things done.

Weaker egos are harder to read, which makes it more difficult to determine your own course of action. They also operate with lower expectations  of  themselves  -  which  means  that  dealing  with  them will take more time and you will accomplish less.

Once  you  have  determined  the  strength  of  a  person's  ego,  you can  cope  with  a  range  of  pragmatic  questions:  how  direct  and forthright are his answers? How quickly will he make a decision, and once he has made it will he vacillate? Is he consistent? Is he upfront or  would he rather operate from behind a wall? Does he deal with the facts as they are or as he would like them to be?

And, most important of all: how secure is this person?

A person's 'security quotient' has a direct bearing on how he will behave in business situations.  Will  he  be  stubborn  or  reasonable? Will  form  be  more  important  than  substance?  What  excesses  and

vanities  will  probably  come  into  play?  Is  he  likely  to  say  one  thing and do another? Does he prefer to deal to your face … or to your back?

Instead  of  always  challenging  or  confronting  the  other  person's ego,  it  is  much  easier  and  far  more  effective  to  acknowledge  and understand its impact on your business, and use this information to your advantage.

One final question of ego needs to be considered, and that is your own. Nothing blocks insight  into  other  people  more  than  your  own ego.  Be  aware  of  your  strengths  and  weaknesses,  and  how  these are likely to slant your reaction to others. It is difficult to be effective if your conclusions about what makes someone tick are based on your ego rather than on his.

## Useful Impressions

On  any  number  of  occasions  I  have  gone  into  situations  which ultimately did not work out the way I would have liked, and yet my favourable impression of the other party - how he or she handled the situation - made me want to deal with that person again. This has often  led  to  opportunities  that  did  work  -  and  which  more  than compensated for any initial disappointments.

When we first tried to represent Chris Evert in 1975 she decided to remain  independent.  But  in  the  course  of  our  series  of  meetings  I was so impressed with her character and her directness and the way she handled herself that I was convinced that there was a 'rightness' to the relationship, and determined that one day we would represent her. Five years later she became a client.

I  have  also  come out of other situations and thought, 'Boy, am I glad that's  over.'  And  while  I  have  never  unilaterally  decided  that  I would not deal with someone again under any circumstances, with some  people  those  circumstances  would  have  to  be  very  special. When  I  was  young  I  was  more  impressed  by  outward  factors  money, power and glamour. But as I grow older and, theoretically, wiser, I've come to appreciate the importance of business character

and  other  inner  qualities  and  to  see  the  relative  insignificance  of outward glitter, whether it be celebrity, position or appearances.

People  who  are  impressed  by  the  superficial  should  make  you wonder how easy it would be to pull the wool over their eyes in a business dealing.

Be alert to the business acquaintance who refers to his 'very close friend'  (usually  someone  whose  name  is  calculated  to  impress)  or implies  that  he  has  a  strong  personal  relationship  with  a  particular associate.  If  you  happen  to  know  the  person  being  claimed  as  a friend, you might want to get that person's version of the relationship. If it turns out that they have met only once or twice, you might start thinking  more  about  the  accuracy  of  his  other  statements.  I  once called  an  employee  on  this  -  a  man  I  knew  had never met  the person he was referring to as his 'best friend'. He gave me one of the best comebacks I have ever heard. 'What I meant,' he said, 'is that he is one of my best phone friends.'

The  people  who  work  with  someone  can  provide  revealing information about that person. A secretary, for instance, who makes a  strong  impression  may  help  you  form  a  perception  of  his  or  her boss.

The  same  thing  goes  for  other  subordinates.  I  had  a  series  of meetings  with  a  high-ranking  executive  at  a  well-known  sporting goods  company.  He  had  a  reputation  as  fairly  competent,  but  he seemed  totally  cowed  and  reluctant  to  commit  to  even  the  most mundane  details.  When  I  met  with  his  boss,  the  company's chairman, I was prepared for what I found - a man who wasn't very good at delegating.

People  within  a  corporation  tend  to  pick  up  many  of  the characteristics  of  their  superiors.  If  you  know  their  boss,  you  can learn quite a bit by judging how well they have adopted their boss's strengths and assets.

Several years ago I was having lunch in Australia with the director of  one  of  the  major  television  stations  there.  He  was  a  well-known figure  in  his  own  right,  but  his  boss,  the  owner  of  an  international communications  conglomerate,  was  one  of  the  most  powerful  and recognizable men in all of Australia.

I had lunched with the director's boss on a score of occasions, and knew that he never signed a restaurant bill. At the end of the meal he would simply get up and leave. It  was  probably  a  vanity,  albeit  an impressive  one:  either  he  had  an  account  with  every  restaurant  in Australia  or  his  habit  was  so  well-known  that  any  restaurant  he patronized knew to bill his office.

In any event, the day of our lunch the station director adopted this particular habit of his superior. As I was about to ask for the bill, the director  announced  it  had  already  been  taken  care  of.  Then,  with some  flourish,  he  got  up  from  the  table  and  walked  out  of  the restaurant.  The  only  problem  was  that  he  was  not  nearly  as  well known as his boss. Much to his embarrassment, an anxious maître d',  who  thought  the  man  was  trying  to  jump  payment,  chased  him down the street.

Obviously, there are no hard and fast rules for reading people or gaining  insight  into  the  personalities  beneath  their  corporate disguises. But if a point of reference exists, if there is some basis for comparison, either to a situation or to other people, examine it. See what evidence it might turn up.

## Take Advantage Of The Venue

I  once  played  mixed  doubles  with  the  chairman  of  a  Fortune  500 company  and  his  wife.  Throughout  the  match  he  berated  her  and blamed  her  for  every  point  they  lost.  Though  she  was  no  Martina Navratilova, he was no Björn Borg himself and lost at least as many points  as  she  did.  But  he  was  simply  incapable  of  admitting  a mistake, and she was the most convenient scapegoat. If he missed a shot and blew the point, he would blame her for distracting him or ask  why  she  hadn't  put  away  the  shot  just  before  it.  This  told  me something  about  what  to  expect  when  dealing  with  the  man  in business.

People often reveal their innermost selves in the most innocent of situations.  How  they  deal  with  a  waiter  or  an  airline  attendant  can provide  a  fascinating  glimpse  beneath  the  surface.  How  impatient

they are in a particular situation, or how upset they get over a minor error can prove invaluable knowledge later on.

Recently I negotiated with the head of the governing body of one of the major international sports. On numerous previous occasions I had  observed  both  his  low  impatience  threshold  and  how  he behaved  once  he  lost  his  temper  -  which  was  to  treat  the  entire situation as an irritant to be waved off, not to be thought about any more.  I  knew  if  we  patiently  and  politely  stuck  to  our  position  he would eventually become irritated enough to dismiss the crux of the negotiation as a minor matter, which is exactly what he did.

Business is a constant process of keeping your own guard up - in fact, it is the only way to do business - while encouraging others to lower theirs. Usually, the less formal the situation or venue, the more likely  people  will  be  to  let  their  guards  down.  You  will  be  surprised how much you can learn from a quasi-business or social-business situation.

I  am a great believer in breakfast, lunch and dinner meetings for this  reason.  If  it  is  a  new  business  relationship,  I  am  often  just  as interested in observing the other party as I am in any business that may be discussed.

I was once having lunch in New York with someone I had not met before but I knew from previous phone conversations that we were likely to be negotiating with one another.

When the menus came, he told me he was on a strict diet and was going  to  have  only  a  cup  of  coffee.  This  was  a  fairly  prominent restaurant, and I found it interesting that he was not intimidated into ordering something just for the sake of ordering it.

But when the waiter came, and I asked my guest out of politeness if  he  was  sure  he  wouldn't  have  just  a  salad,  he  said,  'Maybe  I should,' and added, 'I'll have whatever you're having.'

I found this even more interesting. If he could change his mind so easily,  I  had  to  wonder  just  how  firm  his  'final'  position  in  a negotiation might be, how easily influenced he would be to follow the lead  in  any  negotiation  -  and  even  whether  he  might  make concessions based on convenience rather than convictions.

None of this, of course, was to be taken literally. But I did think I had gained some insight that might prove helpful in my dealing with

the man in the future.

Fish-out-of-water venues - or any small gathering in which people are forced to interact and operate outside their own comfort zones can  also  be  educational.  I  am  constantly  mixing  diverse  groups  of friends,  clients  and  business  associates  for  this  reason.  I  find  it instructive,  for  instance,  to  see  how  some  of  our  sports  clients respond to people from the world of business.

This,  in  part,  helps  me  determine  the  degree  to  which  I  should expose  clients  to  customers  and  licensees  prior  to  a  commitment. Some  -  Arnold  Palmer,  Gary  Player,  Jackie  Stewart,  John Newcombe and Jean-Claude Killy come immediately to mind - you can 'take anywhere', and their personality is a key part of our sales effort.  But  others,  if  they  aren't  talking  about  themselves  or  to someone in their field, have nothing to say.

## Observe Fringe Times

Formal  business  situations,  highly  structured  meetings,  negotiating sessions or other forms of business interaction are likely to be the least revealing because these are the times when people are most likely to have their 'game faces' on.

So,  consciously  tune  in  to  the  fringe  times,  the  beginnings  and endings, the periods of transition, which are when people are most likely  to  let  their  guard  down.  During  a  two-hour business meeting, the  first  several  minutes  -  before  you  actually  get  down  to  the business at  hand  -  and  the  last  several  minutes  -  as  everyone  is saying  goodbye  -  can  tell  you  more  about  the  people  you  are dealing  with  than  almost  anything  else  that  goes  on  in  between. These are, unfortunately, the times when you are likely to be least observant. Try to sharpen your awareness.

Also, be aware of people during interruptions, unusual exchanges or  anything  that  intrudes  upon  the  more  formal  flow  of  a  business situation. There is a certain amount of role-playing in most business encounters,  and  when  someone  'breaks  ranks'  the  façades  are going  to  crack  a  little.  Simply  noticing  who  does  the  breaking  and how others respond with words and eyes can tell you a lot.

There is a scene in The Godfather that perfectly illustrates this: the Godfather has just flatly rejected an offer from the Mafia boss to get involved  in  the  drug  business,  when  Sonny,  his  hot-headed  eldest son,  blurts  out  that  even  the  terms  that  have  been  proposed  are insulting to the family.

This,  of  course,  leads  to  the  attempt  to  eliminate  the  Godfather. The other Dons have correctly perceived a break in ranks, for by the act  of  objecting  to  the  terms  Sonny  has  revealed  a  greater willingness than his father to consider the deal.

Though The Godfather is fictional, its psychology is very real.

## Golf-Course Insight

I am passionate about the game of golf. I have played it most of my life and have spent more time than I should trying to figure out what I find  so  intriguing  about  getting  a  small  white  ball  into  a  small  dark hole.

Part of the reason, I'm sure, is the range of emotions a round of golf can bring out, and the array of personality traits it reveals.

I have often said that I can tell more about how someone is likely to react in a business situation from one round of golf than I can from a hundred hours of meetings. Maybe golf cuts more directly to the psyche  than  other  games  and  situations.  Or  maybe  it's  the  venue itself - green grass and rolling hills. It's astonishing how so simple a game can reveal so much …

## THE GIMME PUTT

A  gimme  ('Give  me')  is  a  short  putt  conceded  to  the  golfer  by  his playing  partner  or  opponent.  It's  interesting  to  observe  the  broad behavioural spectrum relating to this tiny aspect of social golf.

Some people refuse all gimmes, insisting on putting everything in the hole, and accurately recording the results.

Business translation: it's hard to do a favour for people like this.

Others don't even wait, and assume it's a gimme - even if it's six feet  from  the  cup.  These  are  usually  the  big  egos  who,  if  they

stopped  to  think  about  it  (which  they  never  do),  would  figure  they could 'command' the ball into the hole anyway.

Business translation: they won't ask you for a favour either; they expect it.

Most intriguing to me are the people who 'half try' to sink the putt, sort of sweep at it one-handed. If it goes in, fine; if it doesn't, they 'weren't really trying' and count it as a gimme.

In  business,  these  people  are  hard  to  pin  down.  They  have  a capacity for self-deception, tend to exaggerate, and may give you a rounded-off version of what they originally said.

## 'WHAT DID YOU SHOOT?'

I've played golf a number of times with the Chief Executive Officer of a major corporation. When he's had a bad round he always shoots the same thing: 'I had a seventy-nine.' Of course, that 79 includes a few post-gimme putts (after they rimmed the hole) and a couple of memory lapses in counting up strokes. What's interesting is that he really believes he shot a 79.

This kind of individual makes me nervous in a business situation. He has a  capacity  for  creatively  interpreting  facts,  then  sticking  to them until they become gospel.

## 'WHAT'S YOUR HANDICAP?'

Most people will  be  reasonably  accurate  about  their  handicap.  But some will  inflate  it,  maybe  even  doubling  it.  These  are  the  people who want to con you,  the  ones  who  won't  enjoy  the  round  unless they take your money. That's also the way they will probably want to do business.

Others will tell you their handicap is less than it actually is. These people are trying to deceive the world about how good they actually are. They tend to dismiss their bad performances: 'I'm having an offday today.' How many times have you heard that in business?

## WINTER RULES

Winter rules - improving your lie in the fairway - are invoked when the  fairways  are  in  bad  shape.  It's  kind  of  funny  how  wide  the fairways can become for some people, particularly if there's a tree in

the 'fairway' between their ball and the green. No great psychological insights needed here: these people cheat!

## THE RULES OF GOLF

A course's local rules - or how the rules of golf apply to that specific course  -  are  clearly  stated  on  the  back  of  the  scorecard.  What's amazing to me is not so much the interpretations that some golfers give  to  local  rules,  but  the  mental  contortions  they  go  through  in getting there. I'd much rather deal with someone who says, 'See that white out-of-bounds marker over there? Screw it,' than I would with someone who is still explaining his interpretation to me three holes later.

## Watching People/Reaching People: My SevenStep Plan

Obviously,  there  aren't  seven  steps  or  seventy  steps  or  seven hundred steps to learning to read people by opening up your senses. That's the whole point: if it was that categorical it could be learned in a  classroom.  Nevertheless,  what  I can say  categorically  is  that learning to read people involves a few basic fundamentals:

## STEP 1: LISTEN AGGRESSIVELY

Listen not only to what someone is saying, but how he is saying it. People tend to tell you a lot more than they mean to. Keep pausing a slightly uncomfortable silence will make them say even more.

## STEP 2: OBSERVE AGGRESSIVELY

Have  you  ever  said  to  yourself  when  watching  a  chat  show  or  a news interview, 'Oh, that person's nervous,' or 'Aha! That question made him uncomfortable'?

You  don't  need  to  read  a  book  on  body  language  to  interpret certain motions or gestures, or to 'hear' the statement someone may be making simply by the way he or she is dressed.

STEP 3: TALK LESS

You will automatically learn more, hear more, see more - and make fewer blunders. Everyone can talk less and almost everyone should be talking less.

Ask questions, and then don't begin to answer them yourself.

## STEP 4: TAKE A SECOND LOOK AT FIRST IMPRESSIONS

I  usually  go  with  my  first  impressions,  but  only  after  I've  carefully scrutinized  them.  Some  sort  of  'thinking  out'  or  contemplative process has to take place between your initial impression and your acceptance of it as a tenet of a relationship.

Muhammad  Ali  once  said  to  me,  'I'm  more  famous  than  Jesus Christ' (a line he perhaps borrowed from the Beatles). I was appalled at  the  statement,  dismissed  it  as  braggadocio  and  let  it  go  at  that. But  months  later,  for  some  reason  I  got  to  thinking  about  it  and started  counting  up  all  the  Moslem  and  Hindu  and  other  nonChristian  countries  in  which  Ali  was  extremely  well  known.  The statement was still  braggadocio, but I  realized  it  was  also  possibly true.

## STEP 5: TAKE TIME TO USE WHAT YOU'VE LEARNED

If  you're  about  to  make  a  presentation  or  a  phone  call,  take  a moment to think about what you know, and what is the reaction you want. From what you know of the other person, what can you say or do to be most likely to get it?

## STEP 6: BE DISCREET

Discretion  is  the  better  part  of  reading  people.  The  idea  of  using what you have learned properly is not to tell them how insecure you think  they  are,  or  to  point  out  all  the  things  you  have  perceptively intuited that they may be doing wrong. If you let them know what you know, you will blow any chance of using your own insight effectively.

You don't owe anyone an insight into yourself for every insight you have into him. Remember, you can only use what you've learned if he's learned less about you.

The surest way to let people in on your own security quotient is to tell  them  all  about  your  accomplishments.  Let  people  learn  of  your qualities and achievements from someone else.

## STEP 7: BE DETACHED

If  you  can  force  yourself  to  step  back  from  any  business  situation, particularly  one  that  is  heating  up,  your  powers  of  observation  will automatically increase. When the other person gets a little hot under the collar, he or she is going to be more revealing than at almost any other time. If you come back with an equally heated response, you will  not  only  be  less  observant,  you  will  be  revealing  just  as  much about yourself.

I  am  practically  a  missionary  for  the  importance  of  acting  rather than reacting in any business situation.

Acting rather than reacting allows you really to use what you have learned.  It  allows  you  to  convert  perceptions  into  controls.  By reacting, by failing to step back first, you are probably throwing this powerful advantage away.

If  you  don't  react  you  will  never over -react.  You  will  be  the controller rather than the controlled.

## Creating Impressions

In 1964 I was walking down a street in Seattle with Bob Hope and Arnold Palmer when a woman came up to Hope and said, 'Do you remember me? We met two years ago in Cincinnati.' Hope was very polite, but obviously had no idea who the woman was. After she left he turned to Arnold and me. 'Can you believe that?' he said. 'You meet ten thousand people a year and someone comes up to you two years later and expects you to remember her name.'

As for me, I am pretty bad with names, and I presume everybody else is pretty bad with names too. No matter how many times I have met  someone,  if  I  am  not  one  hundred  per  cent  sure  that  person knows my name - first and last - I am going to open with 'I'm Mark McCormack.'

This  is  a  minor  point.  But  that's  exactly  what  making  the  right business  impression  is  all  about.  The  day-to-day  flow  of  business rarely provides for the Monumental Act or the Grand Gesture. Just as you can gain some of the greatest insights into people by the little things they say and do, it is the little things you say and do that often make the most enduring impression.

How people relate to you in business is based on the conscious and unconscious statements you make about yourself. The way you dress,  your  phone  manner,  your  efficiency,  the  way  you  phrase  a letter, the way you greet people, all affect the impression you make on others - their 'reading' of you - making people perceive you in the way that you want to be perceived.

It is an artful form of manipulation. One of life's big frustrations is that people don't do what you want them to do. But if you can control their  impressions of you, you can make them want to  do  what  you want them to do.

In any new business situation there is a kind of mutual sizing up that goes on between the players. Each is trying subtly to exert his or her influence over the other. Whoever is better equipped to control the  impressions  being  formed  will  walk  away  accomplishing  the most, certainly in the short term and most likely in the long term as well.

A  friend  of  mine  calls  this  flashpoint  of  human  contact  the 'pyrotechnics of business'. While I can agree with this terminology in terms of the importance and impact of creating impressions, it may belie the subtlety of the process.

Obviously,  people  who  think  they  are  being  manipulated  and controlled  won't  be.  The  most  effective  executives  impress  in unobtrusive ways. Sometimes this is a simple act or gesture that, if never made, would probably never be missed; that's precisely why it will be noticed when it is made.

Often,  particularly  in  negotiations,  the  way  something  is  phrased totally alters the dynamics of the relationships involved. I have even seen it come down to the addition or deletion of a single word or two, the use of an 'I agree,' for instance, even when you don't, and before cancelling it out with a 'but …'.

I  was  once  having  lunch  with  Ray  Cave,  the  managing  editor  of Time magazine, and when we reached the restaurant Ray greeted the maître d' with 'Good to see you again .'

The maître d' perked right up and immediately led us to our table. After he disappeared, I said to Ray, 'I thought you told me you had never eaten here before.'

'I haven't,' he said.

A colleague of Ray Cave, Patricia Ryan, the managing editor of People magazine,  once  told  me  that  if  she  is  having  a  business lunch in which she anticipates being intimidated or not being taken seriously  enough  she  will  order  a  Scotch  and  water.  She  rarely drinks,  but  just  ordering  a  Scotch  instead  of  a  Perrier  creates  a subtle, almost imperceptibly different I-mean-business impression.

The subtlety of making impressions, of course, is what demands the self-awareness - conscious connection between the impression you create and the impression you want to create. Often people who think  they  are  being  impressive,  who  make  a  show  of  it  or  of

themselves, are indeed creating very strong impressions, almost all bad.

But even worse than a skewed self-awareness is none at all. Have you ever seen a business executive, discovering there is a problem with  an  airline  reservation,  start  to  yell  and  scream  at  the  ticket clerk?  Here  is  the  one  guy  left  with  the  power  to  get  him  on  that plane, and he goes out of his way to alienate him.

This  is  the  own-worst-enemy  syndrome.  Even  if  you  have something worth saying, if you express it in a tone or a manner that is a turn-off, it guarantees no one will listen.

Be  aware  of  all  the  subtle  opportunities  you  have  every  day  for impressing positively and all the not-so-subtle opportunities you have for  impressing  negatively.  Creating  the  right  impression  can  be  as simple  as  treating  people  the  way  they  want  to  be  treated.  Or  as difficult as treating them that way even when they beg not to be.

The impression you've made is what allows you to be less than perfect.  If  you  can  take  advantage  of  all  the  little  opportunities  to create an overall ongoing impression of competence, effectiveness, maturity and fair-minded toughness - the kind of person people want to do business with - they will overlook the occasional transgression. People will forgive all  sorts  of  'out-of-character'  behaviour  in  you  if their overall lasting impression is a favourable one.

## Play Off Preconceptions

Consider  doing  the  opposite  of  what  someone  expects.  Often,  it's remarkably effective.

If  someone is expecting toughness, it is amazing what a simple, self-effacing  remark  will  do.  If  someone  anticipates  a  hard  line, making  an  immediate  insignificant  concession  is  a  good  way  to begin.  The  more  someone  thinks  I  want  something  from  him,  the more I will go out of my way to appear that I don't.

Recently, we very much wanted to sign up a reticent client, a wellknown television personality who knew how badly we wanted to sign her and was expecting us to pull out the stops. In two get acquainted meetings I told her a little about myself and our company and talked

a  lot  above  her  career,  her  opportunities  and  how,  if  I  were  in  her shoes, I would go about taking advantage of them.

I  never  even  mentioned  the  subject  of  representation.  Naturally, she  began  to  wonder  why  we  weren't  pursuing  her  more aggressively - and she began to pursue us.

If  I  am  presumed  to  be  knowledgeable  about  a  situation,  I  will often say something within the first minute or two of a meeting that might  indicate  otherwise.  At  the  very  least  it  is  disarming,  and generally the less knowledgeable one appears, the more forthcoming and revealing the other party will be.

Conversely, if I am thought to be in the dark, I will drop one or two innocent  comments  that  let  the  other  person  discover  that  I  know more than he thinks I do.

In  international  business  dealings,  I  have  seen  the  language barrier  -  or  a  perceived  language  barrier  -  used  effectively  in  this manner. No comprende, and its hundreds of linguistic variations, is a very useful business tool.

Americans, who are probably less conversant in second and third languages than almost any other nation (and are often defensive and insecure  about  it)  are  particularly  vulnerable  to  language  barriers, and  foreign  executives  routinely  take  advantage  of  this  fact.  The businessman who artfully  drops  one  or  two  perfect  phrases  in  the other person's native tongue may find he's won a useful advantage.

Culture  and  customs  are  interesting  even  within  the  various regions  of  the  United  States.  A  born  and  bred  New  Yorker,  for instance, doing business in the South, is often vulnerable to what he perceives to be his own hard edge, and I have seen many Southern businessmen skewer 'Yankees' on their own vulnerability. Whenever there  is  a  perceived  cultural  contrast  -  big  city  v.  small  one, entertainment  industry  v.  Wall  Street  -  there  is  probably  an advantage for someone.

I have seen some people play off their own culture and customs. We  deal  with  a  very  successful  sports  promoter  in  Japan  by  the name  of  Atsushi  Fujita,  whose  methods,  on  occasion,  can  be somewhat  unconventional.  Several  years  ago,  Mr  Fujita  was representing the Japanese television rights to the Rose Bowl when one  of  the  Japanese  networks  made  an  offer  directly  to  the  Rose

Bowl Committee. When Mr Fujita learned of this, he drove over that night  to  see  the  network's  chairman  and  took  his  daughter  along. Standing on this gentleman's doorstep, and clasping the hand of his young daughter in his own, Mr Fujita told him that if the network offer was not withdrawn, he, Mr Fujita, would lose face in America. Two days later, Mr Fujita had the Rose Bowl back.

## Letters As Emissaries

Correspondence - both internal and external - is one of the most frequent  opportunities  you  have  for  presenting  yourself  to  the business community.

I'm a real stickler about any written communication that goes out over my name. I insist that it be neatly typed ('pleasing to the eye') and  contain  no  spelling  errors  or  typos.  There  are  few  things  in business that you can easily make stick, but this is one of them.

It frustrates  me  to  hear  a  secretary  say,  'It's almost right.' Correspondence  forms  a  strong  subliminal  impression  about  how you  run  your  business,  and  I  don't  want  someone  to  think  I  run  it 'almost  right'  when  I  have  such  a  simple,  obvious  opportunity  to impress otherwise.

I try to take the time to personalize all my  business correspondence  -  with  anything  from  a  couple  of  sentences  to  a couple  of  paragraphs  -  to  refer  to  some  personal  interest  of  the recipient which has little or nothing to do with the subject of the letter.

This can mean bringing up a recent business deal that I know has gone  his  way;  acknowledging  his  interest  in  a  local  sports  team ('How  about  those  Browns?'  or  'Did  you  get  to  the  game  on Sunday?');  or  asking  something  about  his  family.  It  can  mean expressing support - hoping that his workload has eased up or that he will finally get a break he's been looking for.

It  is  particularly  impressive  to  personalize  an  initial  solicitation letter.  It's  bound  to  get  noticed  because  it  will  invariably  raise  the question, 'How did he know that?' which will show, if nothing else, that you've taken the time to do some homework.

I  also  keep  extensive  lists  of  business  Christmas  cards  and Christmas gifts which I send out every year. The autumn and holiday seasons are our busiest time, as they are with most businesses, and so every year it would be easy to convince myself to skip it, that no one really cares and probably won't even notice. That's what a lot of people do, and that's precisely why I don't.

Because  they  are  so  outrageously  impersonal,  form  letters  are awful.  I  don't  think  I've  ever  heard  anyone  say,  'I  received  a  great form letter today.' The only thing worse than a 'Dear Sir' letter is one in  which  your  name  has  been  carefully  typed  in  a  space  provided (usually spelled wrong), with the signature in fake ink! Have you ever seen a printed 'signature' that looked real?

With the advent of the memory typewriter, I don't understand why form letters still exist. Yet they do, a monument to the triumph of bad form over possibly good content.

Marking an envelope 'personal and confidential' for no real reason guarantees you a strong and immediate negative impact. Deception never makes a very good first impression. If you have to resort to using  'P&C'  to  get  someone  to  read  your  correspondence  you  are probably doing a number of other things wrong as well.

Under the right circumstances, speed attracts. Telegrams, telexes and cables get more attention than letters sent through regular mail. They carry an aura of importance that results in their generally being delivered immediately to the addressee rather than being diverted to a secretary. The same can be said for Air Express, although this has become so common it's lost much of its impact.

## You're Known By The Office Company You Keep

As we have seen, your secretary is your official link with the outside world and how she deals with it is a mirror image of how the outside world sees you. If she is abrupt, you are perceived to be abrupt. If she  drops  confidential  information  you  are  perceived  to  drop confidential information. If she drops names on your behalf, you are perceived  as  a  name  dropper.  If  she  is  officious  and  overbearing, then you are thought to be officious and overbearing.

The secretary of a leading British television executive consistently makes it impossible for me to arrange any sort of meeting with her boss. On countless occasions, I have tried to arrange a get-together 'at any time during the next two weeks' only to have his secretary tell mine that he is always 'too busy'. Yet without fail, when I get to the man directly, meetings are easy to arrange.

Of  course,  secretaries  do  play  a  certain  protective  role.  By screening you from others, they enable you to act rather than react to a variety of business situations. However, there is a whole range of positive and negative ways in which this screening can be done. It is often as simple as the difference between saying, 'Who may I say is calling?' and 'Who's this?'

Secretaries  often  come  off  as  drill  sergeants,  and  I've  seen executives  who  are  amused  by  their  abrupt  manner  and  even encourage it. I suspect that those who do think that the abruptness makes them appear that much more important.

Of course, this applies to all subordinates. If they work directly for you,  it  is  likely  that  you  are  being  judged  at  least  partially  by  how they present themselves. So if you become aware of obvious rough edges, it is in your self-interest to point them out.

## Dress As Though You Mean Business

MCA/Universal was legendary for its severe dress code - dark suits and  white  shirts  (its  executives  were  sometimes  greeted  by  'Here come  the  penguins').  What's  interesting  is  that  Lew  Wasserman, their CEO, was not a  stickler  for  formality - far from it. But he was running a fast-growing corporation in a highly volatile industry. And he knew that 'Hollywood types' were invariably perceived as cigarsmoking  hucksters  who  tend  to  stretch  facts  and  round  off  the square corners of a deal. So the MCA dress code impressed in two ways:  it  created  a  positive  image  of  stability  -  while  dispelling  a negative one.

The way you dress forms an immediate, strong impression about who  you  are.  In  general,  it  makes  more  sense  to  be  dressed conservatively. If you accept that you can tell a lot about people by

what  they're  wearing,  it's  safe  to  assume  they  can  tell  the  same things  about  you.  Obviously,  the  more  conservative  your  business dress, the harder you are to read. People who show up for business meetings wearing loafers with no socks, their shirts half unbuttoned, gold chains visibly exposed, can create disturbing generalities about their entire personalities.

Several years ago we hired an executive who came to work the first  day  wearing  nice  grey  slacks,  an  open  silk  shirt  and  a conservative blue blazer. I asked his division head to explain to him that his dress was inappropriate for the office.

Many  of  our  clients  are  in  their  twenties  and  many  of  them, particularly  the  tennis  players,  show  up  for  meetings  dressed casually.  But  many  of  these  twenty-year-olds  are  also  millionaires, and we handle their money: we collect it; we manage it; we invest it. They want our executives to look more like bankers than like tennis players, even nicely dressed ones.

Coco  Chanel  once  said  that  if  a  woman  is  poorly  dressed,  you notice  her  dress,  and  if  she's  impeccably  dressed,  you  notice  the woman.

I  think  she  could  have  given  that  same  advice  to  business executives  -  male  and  female.  As  a  general  rule  it  is  desirable  to have  your  business  dress  say  nothing  about  you  -  other  than perhaps that your clothes fit.

## Split Some Seconds

Whenever  I'm  involved  in  a  new  business  relationship,  I  create situations that allow for split-second efficiency on my part. I will set up a phone call for 10 a.m., and will call precisely at 10 a.m. I will promise to have a letter on somebody's desk by next Monday, and that  letter  will  be  there  by  next  Monday.  I  will  show  up  for  an appointment exactly when I said I would.

Do  this  the  first  few  times  you  deal  with  any  new  business associates  and  they  will  assume  you  conduct  all  your  business affairs that way. Moreover, they'll play along. You will find you will get

the  same  on-time  responses  from  them  that  they  have  come  to anticipate from you.

## Don't Be A Time Thief

The  most  frequent  executive  complaint  is  lack  of  time  -  enough hours in the day to get everything done. Yet these same executives become a lot less aware of time when it's someone else's.

The  quickest  way  to  make  a  lasting  negative  impression  is  to waste someone's time: use it cavalierly, or take up more of it than you need.

If you don't have something to say, don't set up a meeting just to make a contact. A contact who is really worth having will respond to your  'I  just  wanted  to  meet  you'  by  making  sure  you  never  meet again.

Don't  make  people  waste  their  time  in  your  office.  It  is exasperating  to  have  to  sit  in  someone's  office  while  that  person takes prolonged telephone calls. What is even more exasperating is to endure the chatty call that could have been easily handled with 'I am in a meeting. May I call you back in a few minutes?' If you must take  a  phone  call  when  you  have  someone  in  your  office,  excuse yourself, then keep it short.

There are three exceptions to telephone behaviour: when you are training  a  subordinate  and  you  want  him  to  hear  your  telephone technique  or  to  learn  first-hand  about  the  facts  of  a  particular situation;  when  you  decide  that  the  call  might  be  germane  to  the meeting  at  hand;  and  when  the  person  you  are  with  might  be favourably impressed by the person who is calling.

In the early 1970s, Vice President Spiro Agnew, whom I had met once  or  twice,  was  trying  to  reach  me  about  my  representing  the literary rights to a golf short story he had written entitled 'I Can Play Better Than This, But I Never Have'.

I  had  tried  to  call  him  from  my  Chicago  hotel,  but  he  was unavailable,  and  his  office  had  asked  where  he  could  reach  me.  I had said that I would be either in the hotel or in the office of A. C. Spectorski, editor at that time of Playboy magazine.

While my meeting was going on in Spectorski's office his secretary buzzed him and said, 'The Vice President of the United States is on the line for Mr McCormack.' Although the call had nothing to do with the  business  at  hand,  our  meeting  took  on  a  whole  new  aura  of importance.

## Your Own Turf

There are times when one of the best sales techniques in the world is simply to 'show up' - to hop on a plane and go wherever you have to go to meet someone at his convenience, at his office. Sometimes this is dictated by protocol, sometimes by a sense of the situation.

But as a general rule you are far better off having meetings at your own  office.  This  has  very  little  to  do  with  'power  offices'  and everything to do with territorial imperative. Even if all you have is a 'power cubicle', it is still best to meet on your own turf.

First  of  all,  it  is your theatre.  You  can  exercise  control  over  a meeting in your office that you simply don't have elsewhere.

Second, because of the territorial  imperative,  a  meeting  on  your turf  brings  with  it  a  sense  of  'invasion'  by  the  other  party.  There  is tension there, however sublimated it may be. Simply by being polite and making the other person feel comfortable you can diffuse that tension,  and  earn  a  certain  amount  of  confidence  and  trust  even before the meeting begins.

The only office affectation I allow myself is keeping my lights very low. Otherwise, to me, a 'powerful' office is either a very big one or one that is neat, clean and efficient, a place where one can tell that business gets done.

## Mean What You Say

Dow  Finsterwald,  former  PGA  Champion,  now  head  pro  at  the Broadmoor in Colorado Springs, once asked me for a favour. He had seen a print of a Leroy Neiman painting of him playing with Arnold Palmer,  and  he  asked  if  we  could  get  him  a  signed  edition  for  his

clubhouse. I called one of our executives who dealt with Neiman on a regular basis. He said there would be no problem, and I conveyed this news to Dow.

A month later I called that executive - I was in Japan at the time and began telling him in so many words how, early in my career, I had promised to do something for someone, hadn't done it, and how it  had come back to haunt me. As I continued, it became clear that the  executive  had  no  idea  what  I  was  talking  about.  But  as  I approached  the  end  of  my  story  he  blurted  out,  'Oh  my  God,  the Neiman print!' We shipped it off a week later.

Business  promises  are  made  all  the  time,  and  almost  as  often they're broken - needlessly creating a horrible impression. If you say you're going to do something, do it. If you can't do it, think it's more trouble than it's worth, or don't want to do it, then don't say you will. Make up any excuse, but don't even say 'I'll try.' At the very least, that leaves the other party with the impression that you tried - and failed.

If you say you will return a call the next day and you don't, that's enough to influence an entire relationship. There's no business law that says you ever have to return any phone call; just don't say you will.

It is also unwise to put yourself in a position of speaking on behalf of your company if you know there's a possibility, however slight, that your company won't back you up.

Many  years  ago,  several  people  at  Wilson  Sporting  Goods assured Arnold Palmer that if he ever wanted out of our contract with Wilson,  all  he  had  to  do  was  ask.  Years  later  when  Arnold's association with Wilson had begun to deteriorate, I decided to test those assurances. Arnold and I were having lunch with Bill Holmes, Wilson's president, and I asked Holmes, 'If Arnold wants out of the contract  with  Wilson,  can  he  get  out?'  Holmes  nervously  replied, 'The answer is no.'

That incident  was  a  great  education  for  both  Arnold  and  myself. We'd  assumed  that  an  individual  was  speaking  for  the  company because he worked for the company. Arnold's disenchantment with Wilson led ultimately to the dissolution of his contract.

If you promise someone you'll deliver something in a week and it gets there a month later, it's worse than your not having promised it in the first place.

## Making A Notable Gesture

Business  gestures  are  acts  made  on  behalf  or  at  the  request  of someone for the purpose of obligating that person in some way. Both parties  may  not  even  be  aware  of  this  purpose.  You  may  like  a business associate and genuinely want to do him or her a favour, but it  is  the  obligatory  nature  of  the  business  gesture  that  separates  it from a personal one.

Again, subtlety is crucial. The more a favour is perceived as 'owing you one', the less effective it will be.

I  have  dealt  with  executives  who  seem  to  keep  a  running  tab  of favours owed and given. Actually, I don't mind dealing with people of this sort. The point is to do them favours but never ask for one. The 'score'  is  so  important  to  them,  they  will  eventually  go  out  of  their way to create opportunities for you in order to 'get even'.

Business gestures fall into three distinct categories: gestures that are  easily  overlooked,  ignored  or  misconstrued;  gestures  that  are appreciated in passing; and gestures that are appreciated in the long term.

The first category obviously takes in all the gestures that either go unnoticed or actively work against you. There are certain gestures, such as making a call on someone's behalf or helping out one of his associates, that the other party may not even know about. You can't expect people to be appreciative if they don't know why they should be, and it is in your interest to let them know casually when you have made a nice gesture on their behalf. ('We gave some time to your assistant  last  week.'  Or  'I  let  so-and-so  know  how  much  we  have appreciated all your help.')

The blatant favour is another interesting first-case example. If it is too  obvious,  it  can  be  too  easily  misconstrued  (or  correctly construed)  and  will  carry  with  it  a  conscious  sense  of  obligation. Blatant favours can backfire. There are countless times when we are

asked to get some shirts or golf clubs or tickets for someone, and the colour or size is wrong, the swing-weight not quite right or the tickets not very good, with the result that more bad will is created than if the whole exercise had not been attempted in the first place. It is kind of like trying to save the drowning man, breaking his arm in the effort, and then getting sued.

'Good  intention'  favours  (such  as  gestures  made  on  someone's behalf but without their knowledge) also fall into this category. Your good  intentions  may  not  always  be  in  the  other  person's  best interest,  and  this  will  either  irritate  him  or  go  unappreciated,  which will irritate you.

The second category often has to do with time - making the time to  see  someone, taking someone to lunch when the same amount could be accomplished in a five-minute conversation, taking the time over the phone or in a letter to express personal interest or concern.

One of the best 'long-term' favours you can do for someone is to act as someone else's middleman - putting together two parties in whom you have no immediate interest. Both parties will remember.

The most important point about any gesture or favour, big, small, long term or short term, is that if you promise you are going to do something,  either  do  it  or  let  the  other  party  know  why  you  were unable to do it.

It  is  in  these  quasi-business areas that people seem to have the longest  memories,  and  the  overlooked  or  unfulfilled  promise  has  a way of building on itself. Years may go by until one day, out of the blue,  the  person  you  disappointed  will  bring  it  up  as  though  it happened yesterday.

Following  are  acts  and  gestures  that  will  be  appreciated, acknowledged and, over the long term, eventually returned:

## DO SOMETHING FOR THE KIDS

Sometimes, the most impressive gestures are indirect. When my son Todd was in grade school, he was crazy about football. A business associate of mine arranged for Todd to meet the Minnesota Vikings' quarterback,  Fran  Tarkenton.  Todd  was  absolutely  thrilled  -  and I never forgot it.

If you  have  a  client  or  customer  you  want  to  impress,  do something for his kids. It will mean far more to your customer than almost anything you could do for him.

What  do  you  know  about  the  families  of  your  most  important business associates? Have you ever expressed interest or taken the time to find out? It is information that can be well worth knowing.

Five  or  six  years  ago  the  aforementioned  Mr  Fujita  learned  that one  of  his  business  associates,  an  executive  with  Japan  Airlines, had  a  daughter  who  was  a  great  tennis  fan  and  idolized  Martina Navratilova.

Recently, Mr Fujita was promoting a woman's tennis tournament in Tokyo and, still remembering this little fact, he called the executive who had since become head of JAL in Europe. Martina Navratilova would be participating  in  his  tournament,  Mr  Fujita  told  him;  would the  executive's  daughter  like  to  come  to  Japan  and  act  as  her personal  guide?  The  daughter  accepted  immediately  -  and  her father could not have been more appreciative.

There  is  no  better  way  to  become  closer  to  Japan  Airlines  and there is nothing whatsoever inappropriate in the exercise.

## LET PEOPLE OFF THE HOOK

People often agree to do things, and then for a variety of reasons beyond their control are no longer able to do them or may even no longer  want  to  do  them.  Circumstances  may  have  changed;  new information may have altered their desire to make the deal, or they may  have  been  overruled  by  someone  higher  on  the  corporate ladder.

As  a  lawyer,  it's  easy  for  me  to  treat  a  commitment  as  a commitment  and  a  deal  as  a  deal.  But  I've  often  found  that  by recognizing extenuating circumstances and letting someone off the hook I have accomplished much more for myself and my company in the long run.

For a number of years our consulting company had a contract with Wilkinson  Sword.  During  the  mid-1970s  Wilkinson  went  through  a rough period, and Chris Lewinton, its managing director, came to me and  said,  'Mark,  we  are  in  some  difficult  times  and  I  am  going  to

have  to  ask  you,  as  a  favour,  to  let  us  substantially  reduce  the retainer we are paying you.'

Without hesitating, I indicated that would not be a problem. In the following  years  when  Wilkinson  was  back  on  its  feet  they  not  only increased  our  fees  to  make  up  the  difference  but  when  they  were later  acquired  by  Allegheny  International,  the  relationship  was expanded further.

The corollary  to  'Let  People  Off  the  Hook'  is  'Let  Them  Change Their  Minds'.  There's  always  a  temptation  to  come  back  with  'But you said …' or 'But you promised …' If you can take a moment to listen to why someone wants to change his mind, and then place it in the  perspective  of  the  overall  relationship,  you  may  find  it  in  your best interest to let him.

## DRIVE A SOFT BARGAIN

Expanding  on  an  existing  business  relationship  is  almost  always easier than starting a new one. By creating the right impression you make people want to deal with you over and over again. Achieving that often comes down to knowing how hard to push.

I have a close friend and business associate named Kerry Packer, who,  among  other  things,  owns  Channel  Nine,  Australia's  largest commercial television network. Several years ago, David Frost, also a friend of Kerry, called Packer to try to sell him Australian rights to his  upcoming  Nixon  interview  tapes.  Frost  had  spent  a  lot  on  this project and was urgently trying to recoup his investment.

He  told  Kerry  he  wanted  $175,000  for  the  tapes,  but  Packer replied that for Australian rights alone he would not go higher than $160,000. The two of them argued back and forth over the phone, and really weren't getting anywhere. An impasse like this, particularly between friends, can often end in disaster.

Finally, David, in a moment of candour, said, 'Kerry, I really need the $175,000. And I'm sure the tapes are worth it.'

Packer was silent for a long moment. Then he said, 'I've got an idea,  David.  I  have  a  coin  right  here.  Let's  flip  for  the  difference… you call it.'

Frost,  on  the  other  end  of  the  phone,  coughed  nervously  and hesitated. 'All right,' he finally answered. 'Heads.'

'You win,' said Packer.

Where  does  your  self-interest  lie  -  in  a  short-term  gain  or  in  a long-term relationship? Sometimes the best deal you can make for yourself is by driving a soft bargain.

## FLATTER LEGITIMATELY

False flattery is transparent, and can easily backfire.

But legitimate flattery -appreciating and acknowledging someone's genuine business skills from which you have benefited can be quite seductive. It you think someone has acted 'smart' and you have benefited from it, tell him how smart you think he is. (But don't call someone smart just because he bought from you. This falls in  the  category  of  false  flattery  and  raises  suspicions  rather  than trust.)

One of the most effective forms of legitimate flattery is by making the person you are flattering look good in the eyes of others in his company. Several years ago, when Noel Morris was the CEO and Managing  Director  of  Slazenger  in  Australia,  I  tried  to  tie  the longevity of Gary Player's and Jack Nicklaus's contracts to his tenure as CEO. He was flattered that Player's and Nicklaus's interests and fortunes  were  so  directly  tied  to  him,  and  it  didn't  hurt  us  to  have someone  at  Morris's  level  directly  looking  out  for  our  clients' interests.  As  it  turned  out,  the  Slazenger  board  would  not  approve this, but both objectives were accomplished anyway.

## MAKE FRIENDS

All things being equal, people will buy from a friend. All things being not quite so equal, people will still buy from a friend.

Make friends.

You  don't  have  to  become  bosom  buddies  with  everyone  with whom you do business. But call them up occasionally, find out what they're doing, chew the fat - express interest.

It is important in our business to call a client and ask him how he played  over  the  weekend  or  if  he's  sorted  out  a  problem  with  his second  serve,  his  sand  wedge,  etc.  It's  so  simple  to  do,  and  yet sometimes  even  people  in  my  own  company  tend  to  forget  what

these  seemingly  insignificant  phone  calls  mean  to  personal relationships. So did I until I learned the hard way.

After we'd been around a few years and were representing Arnold, Gary and Jack, I knew full well how good our company was and how much better we were than any other alternative a pro golfer could find.  It  was  completely  obvious  to  me  that  if  any  golfer  wanted  the best job done, he would seek us out.

What I failed to realize was that many of the new golfers coming up were not aware of the scope of the services we offered or the full extent of our talents. And if they were, our sit-back attitude and our failure to stroke a few egos came across as both cold and arrogant.

We didn't take the time to go out on the tour and make friends. A few other people did and during the 1970s a lot of the best young golfing talent signed with other managers.

If you're not going to make friends, resign yourself to dealing with neutrals and enemies.

And if you are not going to keep friends, you had better be miles ahead of the competition.

## MAKE MENTORS: MAKE CONFIDANTS

Both  mentors  and  confidants  can  lead  to  very  effective  business relationships. Both will want to buy from you, want to help you out, want to do you a favour whenever they can.

'Mentorism' is simply a matter of seeking advice and direction from someone you trust and respect. Pretty soon, the line between giving you this advice and doing you a favour totally disappears.

Making a confidant does not mean betraying confidences or giving away  corporate  secrets.  It  means  sharing  your  personal  feelings from time to time, passing on information that doesn't affect you but may be helpful to him, or encouraging him to confide in you.

I knew that David Foster, the former Chairman of Colgate, enjoyed one-upping  his  ad  agency,  particularly  when  it  came  to  Colgate's heavy  involvement  in  golf  sponsorship.  I'd  feed  him  whatever information I could pick up on the pro golf tour, and as often as not he would know of opportunities in this area before his agency did. It was harmless enough but it served the very real purpose of helping Foster keep his agency slightly off balance.

We did a lot of business with Colgate.

## BE DISCREET

I don't think there is any way I can over-emphasize the importance of confidentiality in business. People may like what you're telling them, but on a deeper, more subliminal level - the level of trust - they don't like the act of your telling them.

If  one  of  our  tennis  executives  tells  Chris  Evert  Lloyd  all  about what  Martina  Navratilova  is  up  to,  Chrissie  can't  help  but  wonder, 'What is he telling Martina about me?'

It's  this  simple: if you violate a confidence, the act will eventually come back  to  haunt  you.  It  is  one  of  those  business  lessons  that everyone, it seems, has to learn the hard way. But you only have to get  caught  once.  The  result  is  usually  so  embarrassing,  so humiliating and so unnecessary that the lesson sinks in.

One of our financial executives was once talking to Virginia Wade about certain activities of another client. Virginia, who can be a little mischievous,  really  tried  to  draw  out  more  information,  and  was pretty successful. Later on, however, concerned, she told me about the incident and urged me to have someone speak to the executive in question. We did and now he's much more circumspect.

We  have  a  rule  in  our  office  that,  when  you  mention  a  client's name in a letter, you must presume that the client is going to see it. If a letter goes out saying, 'If you don't want John Havlicek, how about John  Madden?'  I  guarantee  you  that  somehow  both  Havlicek  and Madden are going to find out about it.

Even  if  you  think  you  know  where  someone's  loyalties  or  selfinterests  lie,  don't  assume  that  a  request  for  confidentiality  will  be honoured and don't commit it to paper, period.

Even when you have nothing to hide, discretion is still the better part of business valour. We once had a major client who had a very volatile  relationship  with  an  outside  mentor/adviser.  In  the  down periods,  this  client  would  always  tell  us  he  was  getting  rid  of  his adviser  and  would  ask  us  what  we  thought.  On  one  occasion  we made the mistake of telling him.

We misjudged the influence of the other person, and in doing so antagonized  him  so  much  that  it  seriously  jeopardized  the

relationship we had with our client. We would have been much better off saying nothing and remaining neutral.

Indiscretion  and  breaking  confidence  always  leads  to  problems that, in retrospect, you can't believe you created for yourself.

## The Most Important Personal Asset In Business

Obviously, the real answer is common sense. But if you don't have it already, you probably never will, and there's nothing I can say here that's going to change that.

Common sense aside, then, the most important asset in business is a sense of humour, an ability to laugh at yourself or the situation.

Laughter  is  the  most  potent,  constructive  force  for  diffusing business tension: so be the one who controls it. If you can point out what is humorous or absurd about a situation or confrontation, can diffuse the tension by getting the other party to share your feeling, you will be guaranteed the upper hand. There are very few absolutes in business. This is one of them, and I've never seen it fail.

John  Kennedy  probably  understood  it  as  well  as  anyone.  He diffused  Congress  and  an  always  hostile  press  with  a  sense  of humour  when,  at  times,  that  was  all  he  had  going  for  him.  No President since Kennedy has ever really figured it out.

A sense of humour creates one of the most favourable long-term impressions. A  single humorous,  self-effacing comment  can immediately  let  someone  know  that  you  don't  take  yourself  too seriously, and that is the sort of thing that people remember.

It is also the best way to start a meeting. You don't need to have them rolling in the aisles, but a mildly pleasant remark at the outset will create the right atmosphere for everything that follows.

Finally,  humour  is  what  brings  back  perspective,  which,  next  to profits, is the easiest thing to lose in business.

Many years ago the Ford Motor Company went through a period in which the numbers people literally took over the company and were closing plants left and right in order to cut costs. They had already succeeded in shutting down plants in Massachusetts and Texas and seemed to be relishing their newly found power.

Robert McNamara, who was President of Ford at the time, called a meeting of his top executives to discuss a recommendation he had received for the closing of yet another plant. Everyone was against it, but the predictions from the accountants were so grim no one was willing to speak up.

Finally, a salty Ford veteran by the name of Charlie Beacham said, 'Why don't we close down all the plants and then we'll really start to save money?'

Everyone  cracked  up;  the  decision  was  made  to  postpone  any more  closings  for  a  while;  and  the  bean  counters  went  back  to working for the company rather than running it.

## Being Yourself

Everyone has, or should have, certain principles by which he or she lives  and  conducts  business.  But  more  sins  are  committed  in  the name of 'principle' than in almost any other I can think of.

'Principle' is too often a convenient cover-up word for bruised ego. There are a lot of insensitive, insulting people out there, and I think there  are  occasions  when  it's  perfectly  acceptable  to  take  certain actions  in  the  name  of  bruised  ego.  But  don't  call  it  'principle'  if  it isn't. That's a dangerous form of self-deception.

Speaking  of  deception,  there's  a  big  difference  between  playacting  and  miscasting  yourself.  The  difference  should  be  obvious, but if there's ever any confusion over when to play a role and when to be yourself, stick with the latter.

Obviously, a great deal of role-playing goes on in business. If you consistently  present  your  'up-front-warts-and-all'  self,  you're  not going to be very effective. The key is to come across as your best self by playing a role that features your strongest business qualities and hides your worst.

The classic own-worst-enemy cases are those people who don't know the difference between honesty and tact. Everyone's heard the twist  on  the  cliché,  'Honesty  is  not  always  the  best  policy.'  I  think that's misleading, implying that sometimes in business it's OK to lie. It  is  more  appropriate, and more accurate, to say, 'Honesty can be

mitigated,' couching the truth in such a way that it is neither insulting nor self-destructive.

The  other  extreme  is  being  too  anxious  to  please.  I  have  seen people  playing  a  role  'get  on  a  roll'.  Pretty  soon  they  are  saying things  they  can't  possibly  back  up  and  promising  things  they  can't possibly deliver. Once you can't deliver what you promise, you are perceived as lacking authority, and the ultimate impression you end up creating is one of weakness.

## Emotion Management

None of us has the luxury of doing one thing at a time, and it is very easy to allow the emotions attached to one activity to spill over into another. If a big deal has just fallen through, it is hard not to convey some feeling of disappointment to the next person you talk to. Or if you  are  feeling  particularly  harassed,  impatience  or  irritation  can often creep into a phone call or meeting.

Compartmentalizing, leaving the emotions of a particular situation locked within the confines of that situation, is one of those things that is  easy  to  advise  and  very  hard  to  do.  I  have  found  that  a  partial solution  is  to  compartmentalize  my  day  and  week  functionally  answering  letters  in  the  morning,  returning  phone  calls  in  the afternoon, limiting meetings to particular meeting days, and so on.

It  is  also  important to force yourself to act rather than to react to situations. For example, I rarely take calls, but I always return them. You are much less likely to snap at someone on the phone if you are initiating the phone call than if you are being interrupted by it.

In  the  end,  compartmentalizing is mostly a conscious process of putting some emotional distance between yourself and the situation.

## You Don't Have To Be Perfect

It  is  not  very  popular  these  days,  or  even  politic,  to  claim  that  you know  John  DeLorean,  much  less  that  you  ever  did  business  with him. I do, and I did. DeLorean's sin was hubris, not incompetence,

and  the  fact  remains  that  anyone  who  was  able  to  rise  so meteorically  through  the  concrete-hard  bureaucracy  at  General Motors understood something about business.

I first met DeLorean when he was already head of Pontiac. During the  course  of  a  couple  of  meetings  (he  was  an instant decision maker)  I  had  more  or  less  convinced  him  that  Pontiac  should associate  itself  with  the  US  Ski  Team,  with  a  commitment  totalling seven figures. We agreed to meet several weeks later at Pontiac's ad  agency,  MacManus,  John  and  Adams,  in  Detroit  to  talk  about specifics and finalize the deal.

This is precisely the kind of promotional campaign that advertising agency executives hate. They knew that DeLorean and I had agreed to something, but  had  no  idea what. They  weren't  even  sure  how their agency fitted in, if at all.

The day of the meeting arrived and I was primed. Here, at one end of the table, was the maverick from Detroit, one of the most powerful men in the automobile industry, and here I was at the other end, a young  sports  entrepreneur  from  Cleveland.  In  between  were  all these nervous-looking MacManus executives, and I already had the deal in my back pocket. I was feeling invincible.

The whole tone of the meeting was set by 9:01 a.m. The meeting had been scheduled for nine and we were waiting for Ernie Jones, Chairman of MacManus, to arrive. DeLorean looked at his watch and said, 'Let's start.'

By the time the conversation turned to the specific nature of the tie-ins between the US Ski Team and Pontiac, I was totally winging it. After making several other suggestions I launched into a fairly long soliloquy  about  some  ideas  I  had  for  tying  in  the  ski  team  with Pontiac's Indian Head logo, which had been the company's symbol for many years.

As I talked I noticed that everyone's eyes had started darting back and forth, from me to DeLorean. DeLorean was totally impassive, but I  sensed  from  the  others  in  the  room  that  I  wasn't  being  as impressive as I thought I was and that maybe it was time to shut up.

After  a  moment  of  silence  -  in  fact  several  long  moments  DeLorean  smiled.  'Mark,  you  really  researched  the  hell  out  of  us.

Pontiac's just spent a little over three million dollars getting rid of the Indian Head symbol and developing a new logo.'

The deal went through anyway but I don't think I've ever been so ill-prepared for a meeting since then.

I  once  heard  someone  say,  'Everyone  makes  errors.  It's  when those errors are repeated that it becomes a mistake.' You don't have to be perfect, but you should learn from your imperfections.

## 3 Taking the Edge

Taking  the  edge  is  the  gamesmanship  of  business.  It  is  taking everything you know about others and everything you have allowed them to know about yourself, and using this information to load the deck  -  to  tilt  a  business  situation  slightly  to  your  advantage.  It  is winning through intuition.

In  the  beginning  it  is  a  matter  of  doing  your  homework,  knowing the players and all knowable aspects of the game. And in the end it is  knowing  how  to  play  the  game  itself  -  figuring  out  what  people want or convincing them of what they want and finding a way to give it to them. The idea, of course, is to give slightly less than you get in return.

I  strongly  believe  that  in  any  business  situation  there  is  an  edge out  there  for  the  taking.  Don't  be  greedy,  don't  be  pushy,  don't  be impatient, but keep looking for the edge. Eventually it will show itself, and when it does be ready to do whatever you have to do to take it.

## Know The Particulars

You can't take an edge until you have first taken a look at the facts. Facts alone won't guarantee you an edge, but they can protect you from handing it over to someone else. Unless you know all or most of  the  pertinent  'givens'  that  define  the  situation,  you  are  dealing from  a  partial  deck.  Assume  that  the  one  fact  you  don't  know  maybe because it's a little  harder  to  find  out  -  is  the  one  that  will make the difference.

There are many shortcuts in business, but this isn't one of them. Do the necessary spade-work. Take the time and make the effort to learn everything you can about the companies and the people you

are  dealing  with.  The  operative  facts,  the  ones  that  define  the situation, will start to present themselves.

There is a second set of facts which must often be intuited. These are the ones that arise out of the situation itself - things that people say and do which can provide new and useful insights. I have seen, heard of, or been involved in countless business situations where the emergence  or  the  sensing  of  a  single  fact  totally  altered  the dynamics or the tactics of everything that followed.

The first time I attempted to sell the American television rights to the British Open Golf Championship, that is exactly what happened. I had  been  negotiating  with  the  Head  of  Sports  for  one  of  the networks. When we met to close the deal, I brought along one of our top  television  executives  and  he  brought  along  someone  from  his 'Business Affairs' department (networkese for lawyers and accountants).

Within minutes I knew the meeting would go nowhere. The Head of  Sports,  who  was  doing  the  talking,  was  not  about  to  concede anything in front of his Business Affairs guy or to depart in any way to  'break'  -  from  what  the  two  of  them  had  discussed  prior  to  the meeting. The presence of my television executive, with whom they dealt  more  frequently,  only  exacerbated  the  situation.  They  did  not want to appear to fold to any of my demands in front of him.

These were the operative facts that far outweighed all the others. It no longer mattered what I was selling or what they were buying or if  we  kept  talking  for  a  week.  This  meeting  simply  wasn't  going anywhere and to try to make it would only pull it further apart.

As  soon  as  I  could,  I  suggested  we  end  the  meeting  and  take some more time to think about our positions. The next day I called the network executive, and, away from the influences of others, we concluded negotiations for a rights agreement that has been in effect ever since.

## Know The Players

The  whole  point  in  reading  people,  determining  ego,  finding  soft spots, etc. is obviously to use this information to your advantage - by

exposing what you know about someone to the right stimuli.

For  several  years  I  had  been  trying  to  convince  André  Heiniger, the world-wide chairman of Rolex, to sponsor the construction of a new electronic scoreboard and timing system at Wimbledon. He felt it  was  a  waste  of  money,  and  he  equated  the  sponsoring  of  time clocks  at  sporting  events  with  the  mass-market  watch-makers,  the Seikos and the Timexes of the world.

I knew the only chance I had of ever changing his mind was to get him  there,  which  I  finally  managed  to  do  during  the  Wimbledon fortnight of 1979.

As we sat in the Royal Box, sipping tea and watching the match in progress,  I  could  see  him  taking  everything  in:  the  antiquated elegance  of  the  Centre  Court,  the  excitement  of  the  match,  the beauty and the charm of this very special place.

When the match was over, Heiniger turned to me and made a slow sweeping gesture with his hand.

'This,' he said, 'is Rolex.'

## Size Up The Situation

Once you know the particulars and the players and have analysed all the ramifications, you can start to size up a situation. Step back and see what opportunities exist at the outset.

I  am  a  great  believer  in  'stepping  back',  in  taking  a  moment  to place  any  significant  business  event  -  good  or  bad  -  in  a  larger perspective. I force distance between myself and events as a matter of business course, and treat the need to do so no differently than the need to make phone calls or attend meetings. This may not be 'teachable', but it is 'learnable', because I have had to learn to do it myself. If  everyone did this more regularly, we might see the GNP jump overnight.

Several  years  ago  I  met  a  Venezuelan  oil  and  shipping businessman by the  name  of  Raphael  Tudela.  As  I  have  come  to know,  respect  and  admire  him,  he  has  impressed  me  as  the quintessential  street-smart  executive.  He  has  built  a  billion-dollar business from scratch in less than twenty years. He seldom deals in

written contracts, because his word is his bond. He has always made his own breaks. And his principal business, which is oil speculation, relies on his constant process of seeing opportunities where no one else does and taking advantage of them.

In  other  words,  Raphael  Tudela  is  a  genius  at  taking  the  edge. One of the best illustrations of this - of how he has the facts, knows what people want, and figures out a way to give it to them - is the story of how he got into the oil business in the first place.

In the mid-1960s Tudela owned a glass manufacturing company in Caracas, but, a petroleum engineer by training, he longed to be in the  oil  business.  When  he  learned  from  a  business  associate  that Argentina was about to be in the market for a $20 million supply of Butane gas, he went there to see if he could secure the contract. 'If I could  get  the  contract,'  he  told  me,  'then  I'd  start  to  worry  about where I'd get the butane.'

When he - a glass manufacturer operating alone with no previous connections or experience in the oil business - got to Argentina, he discovered  his  competition  was  formidable:  British  Petroleum  and Shell Oil.

But feeling around a little bit he also discovered something else: Argentina  had  an  oversupply  of  beef  which  they  were  desperately trying to sell. By knowing this one fact - his first 'edge', so-to-speak he  became at  least  an  equal  to  Shell  and  BP.  'If  you  will  buy  $20 million of butane from me,' he told the Argentine government, 'I will buy $20 million of beef from you.' Argentina gave him the contract contingent upon his buying the beef.

Tudela then flew to Spain where a major shipyard was about to close  down  from  lack  of  work.  It  was  a  political  hot  potato  and  an extremely sensitive issue for the Spanish government. 'If you will buy $20 million of beef from me,' he told them, 'I will build a $20 million super-tanker  in  your  shipyard.'  The  Spanish  were  ecstatic  and delivered  a  message  to  Argentina  through  their  ambassador  there that Raphael Tudela's $20 million of beef should be sent directly to Spain. Once again he had found the edge and taken it.

Tudela's final stop was in Philadelphia at the Sun Oil Company. 'If you will  charter  my  $20  million  super-tanker  which  is  being  built  in Spain,' he told them, 'I will buy $20 million of butane gas from you.'

Sun Oil agreed and Raphael Tudela fulfilled his desire to get into the gas and oil business.

## Thinking On Your Feet

As  a  general  business  rule  I  am  dedicated  to  the  importance  of acting instead of reacting - and so never over-reacting - to or within any  business  situation.  The  one  exception  to  this  may  be  the circumstance  in  which  an  edge  or  opportunity  must  be  taken advantage of immediately or it will disappear for ever.

The  need  to  be  opportunistic,  to  think  on  your  feet,  again underscores the importance of tuning in to people - of hearing not only what they are saying but the larger and underlying meaning as well. This alone can tell you when taking an edge is dependent upon an instant reaction.

We  recently  had  a  meeting  in  Chicago  with  McDonald's  for  the purpose  of  renewing  their  commitment  to  the  World  Triathlon Championship, which we produce and televise for them.

As  the  meeting  progressed,  though  no  one  really  came  out  and said  it,  we  began  to  sense  that  they  were  much  more  reluctant  to renew than we had anticipated. For one thing, they were less than pleased with the international coverage. Furthermore, the timing of our  meeting  was  terrible.  McDonald's  had  just  recently  committed themselves  to  constructing  the  swimming  pool  for  the  1984  LA Olympics, and this preoccupied all their promotional thoughts.

Still, we could sense that there was in the room a mood to buy - to commit  to something -  and  who  knew  how  long  that  kind  of momentum was going  to  continue?  Probably  not  a  second  longer than the meeting itself.

Out of the blue, our head of television sales suggested that maybe the Triathlon idea had run its course, and that what we really should be  talking  about  was  an  all-new  yet  conceptually  similar  event:  an international diving championship that would take place annually at McDonald's new pool.

Because  this  one  executive  understood  the  ripeness  of  the moment, instead of walking out with a failure we walked away with a

commitment.

## How To Get Lucky

'Luck,' the cliché goes, 'is the residue of diligence.' As Gary Player once said, 'The harder I practise, the luckier I get.'

Over the years, we have had more than our share of luck. But over the  years  we  have  known  how  to  take  advantage  of  it  -  and  we haven't waited for it to hit us in the face.

This,  indeed,  is  the  essential  difference  between  those  who  are 'fortunate'  in  business  and  those  who  aren't.  The  group  that  is 'naturally  lucky'  can  see  the  tiniest  crack  and  turn  it  into  a  crevice. The  group  that  'never  gets  a  break'  wouldn't  see  opportunity  if  it jumped up and down and then mugged them.

'Getting  lucky'  is  mostly  a  matter  of  recognizing  when  you  have been. Knowing then how to turn it into an edge is the easy part.

Consider the good fortune of Mr Goodfather:

Mr Goodfather (that's his real name) is a commercial horticulturalist  who  waters  and  cares  for  the  office  greenery  for  a number  of  Cleveland  companies,  including  Jones  and  Laughlin Steel. He learned that the Eaton Corporation, another big Cleveland firm - and a major customer of Jones and Laughlin - was moving to the same building, and he called Eaton to see if he could get their account as well.

When he asked to speak to the person in charge of the office, he was mistakenly connected to the person who was really in  charge, Del DeWindt, Chairman and CEO of Eaton.

- 'I  take  care  of  all  the  plants  for  Jones  and  Laughlin  Steel,'  Mr Goodfather said. 'And I'd like to see someone about your account.'

The next morning, Mr Goodfather, wearing his work clothes and his  trademark  black  beret,  was  ushered  into  a  conference  room  to meet  with  several  high-ranking  Eaton  executives,  all  of  whom  had their 'Jones and Laughlin' files in front of them.

Once the case of mistaken identity was cleared up, everyone had a good laugh, and that might be the end of a cute, rather pointless

story.  But  as  Mr  Goodfather  was  leaving  he  turned  to  one  of  the executives and said, 'Now, about your plants …'

He got the account.

## Turn Crises Into Opportunities

People  tend  to  deal  with  crises  only  in  terms  of  their  potential  for disaster. And yet, in a crisis, people are more on edge and agitated than  they  might  otherwise  be  and  their  vulnerability  can  be  turned into a great advantage.

Recently a major, major client called up in a state of panic. One of the client's biggest licensees had decided not to pick up its option, which meant the potential loss of a seven-figure income and a great deal  of  exposure.  The  executive  in  charge  of  this  particular  client panicked  also,  and  by  the  time  I  learned  about  the  situation  the executive had replaced the deal with an even better one.

That  sounds  like  good  news.  But  it  just  so  happens  that  this particular client is paying us far less than we're worth. The client is a prestigious one for us and took advantage of that in working out our representation agreement.

Had our executive not been so quick to solve this crisis, I would have used the opportunity to explain some facts to this client: yes, it was too bad about the particular licensee pulling out; yes, we felt we could  replace  it,  but  only  by  a  great  deal  of  time  and  effort  and maybe  by  calling  in  a  favour  or  two  (which  actually  happened).  I would have then brought up the subject of our fee, to see whether the client might consider paying us what we were worth in the first place.

One of the best rules I know is when a crisis occurs or is in the process of occurring, don't react. Just say you'd like to think about it. Make any excuse, but don't respond. Once you have analysed the crisis in terms of its potential for opportunity as well as its potential for  disaster,  then  you  can  respond.  This  at  least  allows  for  clearheadedness in dealing with the problem, and if you're shrewd about what's going on, and haven't become caught up in the crisis yourself, it may present a very interesting edge.

## Learn To Wait

People who deal with me often marvel at my capacity for handling bad news. This wasn't always the case and, though I haven't learned to like bad news, I have learned to deal with it. Bad news is seldom as bad as it first sounds, and most business disasters are rarely as disastrous as they first seem. Over the years I have learned - and am still learning - the importance of patience, and how destructive the lack of it can be.

It is still amazing to me how the simple passing of time can totally alter a situation, solve problems, render other problems meaningless,  cool  down  confrontations  and  add  a  whole  new perspective. 'What goes around comes around' should be tattooed on the chest of every new, hyperactive executive.

What does this have to do with taking an edge? A lot. Part of being opportunistic  is  waiting,  like  a  cat  in  a  forest,  for  an  opportunity  to come along.  Learning  to  wait,  learning  to  be  patient  has  so  many applications and ramifications it is difficult for me to give one or two examples  without  trivializing  its  importance.  I  would  say,  however, that in our twenty-odd years in business 90% of our successes have involved in some way the need for patience, and 90% of our failures have been caused in part because of lack of it.

Recently,  we  finalized  negotiations  of  Herschel  Walker's  new contract with the New Jersey Generals, which in real dollar value is the largest contract in the history of team sports. The mere fact that we were the ones doing the negotiating is a testament to patience.

We were poised to sign Herschel two years ago, and after several meetings with Vince Dooley, his coach at the University of Georgia, we were convinced we would be successful.

In  early  1983  I  received  a  letter  from  Vince  thanking  us  for  our patience (!)  and  suggesting an appropriate time for a meeting with Herschel.  I  received  this  letter  the  same  day  that  the  news  of Herschel's having signed a professional contract as an undergraduate hit the papers.

Our  Team  Sports  Division  was  devastated,  but  I  suggested  to them that we didn't know all the facts, that both Herschel and Vince were impressed with our approach to sports management, and that

the contract he had signed was only for two years. I implied that with a little  patience we might indeed hear from Herschel Walker again, and I strongly advised that this should not be the last he heard from us.

Herschel became a client twelve months later.

## Discipline Yourself

There  is  a  wide  gap  between  the  number  of  executives  who  are street-smart and the number of executives who think they are. Those who  account  for  this  numerical  discrepancy  are  often  found languishing  in  middle  and  lower-middle  management,  usually blaming  anything  and  anybody  but  themselves  for  their  lack  of advancement. The irony is that many of these executives are quite perceptive, even intuitive.

But  their  instincts  are  bad.  What  they  pick  up  perceptively  they always manage to misuse. Deep down inside they know what should or should not be said and when or when not to say it, but they can't help  themselves.  They  blurt  out  some  indiscretion,  or  can't  check their need to 'tell it like it is', even when they are aware that it is in their  own  worst  interest  to  do  so.  This,  of  course,  is  business immaturity, and it afflicts as many people in their forties, fifties and sixties as it does in their twenties and thirties.

When a business situation must be handled discreetly, how do you rank your discretion? When a humorous or conciliatory remark might have  taken  the  heat  out  of  an  exchange,  how  cooling  was  your influence? The next time you are ready to act impulsively, how good are you at resisting the urge?

How effectively have you used what you know about others and how efficiently have you controlled what they know about you?

## Getting Ahead

One of the better Broadway shows of some years ago was a musical comedy entitled How To Succeed in Business Without Really Trying. The  main  character  was  a  young  employee  who  was  constantly trying  to  impress  his  boss.  In  one  scene  he  arrived  at  work  a  few minutes before nine, and proceeded to loosen his shirt and tie, muss up  his  hair,  fill  the  ashtrays  with  cigarette  butts,  and  throw  papers and  documents  all  over  his  office.  When  the  boss  arrived  a  few minutes  later  he  found  this  employee  'collapsed'  at  his  desk, obviously comatose from working through the night.

It was a funny scene because, while it was obviously exaggerated, it dramatized the ridiculous lengths some people will go to in order to get ahead.

I have never had the 'pleasure' myself of working my way up the corporate ladder, having gone directly from law practice into my own business.  But  I  have  observed:  friends  in  other  companies  who made it to  the  top;  sports  personalities  who  have  parlayed  athletic achievement  into  business  success;  and,  of  course,  our  own executives, many of whom came to IMG by way of business or law school. I find the corporate structure just another venue for peoplewatching.

Assuming  similar  backgrounds  and  capabilities,  why  do  some people  shoot  straight  to  the  top  while  others  seem  to  languish  for ever in the morass of middle management?

I  think  the  overall  answer  lies  in  understanding  the  difference between capabilities and effectiveness , which  is  using  those capabilities to achieve certain ends and results.

People  who  merely  work  up  to  their  capabilities  don't  become stars.

Those who are stars combine their capabilities with other things know-how,  people-sense,  an  understanding  of  how  the  game  is played. They are usually achievers and can show results, but this is because  they  are  effective  in  selling  their  ideas  and  themselves inside the company as well as outside the company.

One of our clients, John Madden, now a sportscaster for CBS, was for many years coach of the perennially successful Oakland Raiders football team. During those championship seasons, Oakland had an all-pro tight end by the name of Fred Belintnikoff.

Madden once said about Belintnikoff, 'If he had played up to his capabilities he would never have been in the NFL. He was slow, he wasn't very big, and he was even a little bit clumsy. I used to scream at him from the sidelines, 'Don't fall down, Fred! Don't fall down!' All he could ever do was catch passes and score touchdowns .'

Fred  Belintnikoff  was  effective.  He  knew  how  the  game  was played, understood teamwork, and had figured out within the system the back doors and alleyways, the personal moves that  would take him where the defence wasn't. He was a star at his position.

## Know The Rules

Is  climbing  the  corporate  ladder  a  game?  Absolutely.  In  fact,  it  is several games all going on at the same time. If you care about your career, you should take these games seriously and want to play all of them well.

If you're an employer, you should be constantly trying to recognize real  talent  and  not  to  be  misled  by  appearances.  If  you're  an employee you must figure out a way to let the true decision-makers know  how  good  you  really  are,  without  making  enemies  of  the people in between.

This  can  get  complicated.  You  have  got  to  be  able  to  jump  up several  notches,  to  alert  those  several  rungs  above  you  to  your talents. At the same time, you must make the middle guys think that, by supporting you and building you up to the top guy, they will look better as managers. You must also prevent these middle managers (who are looking out for their own interests) from stifling you or from

appropriating  your  contributions  as  if  they  were  indeed  their  own. Meanwhile, you must keep your peers as friends and maintain the support of your subordinates. It is not only complicated, it can also get pretty unpleasant, and is one of the big reasons so many people become turned off by working for a company.

Getting  ahead  is  one  of  those  real-world  concerns  of  everyday business life that no textbook can prepare you for. An MBA - or a law or any other degree - can get you in the door. But once inside you need to find a way to let people know your real worth. Can you look good without necessarily making someone else look bad? Can you play the game without playing politics?

The answer, I believe, is yes, but the first step is knowing the rules that  make  up  the  game,  acknowledging  the  hardcore  realities  that influence relationships within the corporate structure. These realities vary widely from company to company, but three general rules come to mind:

## RULE 1: SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST

Darwinism influences almost any pyramid-shaped structure, and the corporation  is  not  only  not  an  exception,  it  is  probably  the  best example.  There  are  simply  not  as  many  presidents  as  vicepresidents,  there  aren't  as  many  vice-presidents  as  there  are managers, and so on. This means a natural antagonism, however subtle  it  may  be,  exists  between  different  levels  of  management, different layers of the pyramid. A friend referred to it in his own highly politicized company as 'a food chain'.

## RULE 2: YOUR PEERS ARE YOUR NATURAL ALLIES

It  amazes  me  how  often  seemingly  intelligent  people  are  not  very smart when it comes to recognizing this. If you alienate your peers, you won't need any other corporate enemies.

## RULE 3: THERE IS ALWAYS A SYSTEM

'The  system'  may  not  be  very  desirable  or  even  work  but  all companies  have  one.  To  get  ahead  you  have  to  know  your company's system and understand how to use it. That's the only way you can work within it, through it, or around it.

## Making Impressions In The Long Term

Almost everything mentioned in Chapter 2 about making impressions applies  to  getting  ahead  with  one  major  addition:  you  are  being judged internally over the long haul.

This  places  less  of  a  premium  on  calculation  and  more  on developing an ongoing support system of friends and allies. You can make a mentor outside the company with a few well-placed phone calls and occasional well-timed get togethers. Mentorism inside the company is a week-in, week-out, month-to-month proposition.

The long haul also means that your big wins and your big losses any single success or failure - are not nearly as significant as you may  think  they  are.  Have  you  ever  heard  anyone  complain,  'The whole  attitude  of  this  company  is,  'What  have  you  done  for  me lately?'' I think that's a perfectly legitimate attitude because it is part of a trade-off: if you have a deal that goes sour or even several in a row,  you  don't  expect  to  get  fired  for  it.  Conversely,  if  you  ride  the same winning horse for too long people will start to wonder about the rest of your stable.

Being judged over the long haul also puts even more of a premium on  patience,  waiting  for  the  right  time  to  say  or  do  something, knowing when to be visible and when to lay low.

Within  the  company,  you  are  also  more  likely  to  be  'found  out'. Your real self is likely to emerge, and your weaknesses as well as your  strengths  are  likely  to  be  discovered.  As  a  result,  you  must realize that 'you get along by getting along'.

## The Love-Me-For-Myself Syndrome

Some people are actually very good at what they do, but take great pride in flaunting their weaknesses as well as their strengths.

We have one employee, a fairly senior executive, who is a very good manager. He motivates; his people are loyal; and he keeps an incredible number of balls in the air.

But  he  has  two  major  weaknesses:  he  tends  to  meddle  and  he talks too much. The annoying thing to me is that he is aware of both,

and seems to go out of his way to flaunt them. It's as though these were  two  perks  that  he's  awarded  himself.  He's  effective  and  will always have a job, but these habits limit him in many other ways.

Practitioners of this love-me-for-myself (what-you-see-is-what-youget) syndrome seem to view it as a mark of security when in reality it is very much the opposite.

## Get Some New Tricks

We have an employee who is always snatching victory from the jaws of defeat. No matter what the circumstances, he acts as though it's the end of the world, as though only a miracle will help him pull this one out. And when he 'miraculously' does, he believes this makes him look good to his superiors, as though the deal could never have happened except for his last-minute heroics.

We had  another  employee,  who  is  no  longer  with  us,  who  was always  snatching  defeat  from  the  jaws  of  victory  -  or  at  least  that was the way he made it seem. Every year, his income projections would look incredibly promising, one year almost 100% above what it actually turned out to be. During the year, of course, this made him look  as  though  he  wasn't  very  good  at  what  he  did,  as  though  he was  screwing  up  half  the  time.  But  the  cumulative  effect  over  the long term was even worse. We began to discount almost anything he said or did by 50%.

Another  bad  trick  I  have  encountered  in  our  company  are executives  who  literally  'hoard'  their  clients  or  customers.  Their overprotectiveness  of  these  relationships  indicates  to  me,  as  their employer,  that  they  have  little  understanding  of  delegation,  of  how our company, and indeed most companies, are structured, and of the interconnections  that  make  it  work.  While  I  may  not  question  the sales skills of some of these executives, I question their aptitude for management.

I  can  think  of  a  hundred  more  examples  of  this  sort  -  from  the executive  who  always  has  some  excuse  that  is  so  outrageous  he figures it won't be challenged, to the one who tells me that if I want him to be effective on the outside then I can't expect him to do what

he is supposed to do on the inside. The point is that people working in  a  company  tend  to  develop  certain  'tricks',  or  patterns  of performance, which they believe place them in a favourable light with their  superiors  or  make  them  seem  indispensable  to  the  company. Yet  many  of  these  patterns  are  so  transparent,  and,  over  the  long term, so predictable, that they tend to have the opposite result.

Since the nature and personality of one company varies from the next, I think the best way to find some 'new tricks' - that is, tricks that work - is to observe people in your own company who have risen quickly  through  the  ranks.  In  the  rah-rah  companies,  for  instance, you won't find any superstar who doesn't have some sort of that rahrah  zeal  as  part  of  his  corporate  persona.  In  our  own  company, which is really a group of twelve separate companies spread around the  world,  I  place  a  high  premium  on  intra-corporate  co-operation and communication. The executives who have gone the farthest are the  ones  who  have  figured  out  this  'trick'  -  who  can  achieve  their divisional  goals  within  the  overall  goals  of  the  company,  who  can make their  division  look  good  while  helping  other  divisions  to  look good.

Step back and look at some of your own 'tricks'. You might find that what you think is promoting your best interest really isn't doing that at all.

Don't be predictable. You don't want to give someone above you the opportunity to say, 'So-and-so is up to his old tricks again.'

## Three Hard-To-Say Phrases

Many people will say certain things because they wrongly assume they are creating the right impression, and will equally wrongly avoid certain other statements for the same reason.

There  are  three  hard-to-say  phrases  which  I  find  myself  saying quite  often.  In  fact  most  chairmen  and  CEO-level  executives  I've dealt with know how and when to say them:

'I DON'T KNOW'

It's  amazing how many people are afraid of these words, think that by using them they will somehow appear inadequate.

When I  first  shook  hands  with  Arnold  Palmer,  I  told  him  I  could make only two guarantees. First,  that  if  I  didn't  know  something,  I would tell him. Second, that when I didn't know something, I would find someone who did.

Today, I probably know more than I did twenty years ago, yet I find myself  saying  'I  don't  know'  more  and  more  all  the  time.  I'll  use  it even when I really do know, sometimes to get more information or to compare versions of what is already 'known', but mostly because I believe  the  self-effacing  approach  is  almost  always  more  effective than  the  know-it-all  approach.  Even  when  you  have  a  definite opinion, it is often better to soften it by allowing for the possibility that you may not be omniscient: 'I don't know, but it appears to me that …'

The inability of people to say 'I don't know', even in innocent social situations,  can  give  you  an  insight  into  their  business  character.  I really do enjoy watching these people squirm sometimes as they try to bluff their way through conversations.

What  these  people  fail  to  realize  is  that  not  admitting  what  you don't know can lead to suspicion about what you do know.

## 'I NEED HELP'

People are often afraid to ask for help or to accept it because they believe that somehow this will show that they are inadequate in their job. If they would think about it for a moment, they would realize that the  system  is  set  up  for  getting  and  receiving  help.  The  whole corporate  assumption  is  that  certain  tasks,  and  effectiveness  in accomplishing  these  tasks,  are  sometimes  better  achieved  by groups  than  by  individuals.  We  have  an  executive  who  insists  on being  the  'Lone  Arranger'.  He  won't  bring  in  a  deal,  or  involve anyone else in it, until he has it totally wrapped up, because he is afraid he won't get all the credit. On several occasions both he and the company would have been far better off if he had asked for help and used some of the talent available to him.

Not  asking  is  such  a  short-sighted  and  narrow-minded  view. Asking for help is the way you learn, expand your knowledge, your

expertise  and  your  value  to  the  company.  It  also  demonstrates  a willingness to work with others.

There are limitations, of course. Asking for the same kind of help repeatedly might indicate some  sort of learning disability. Nevertheless,  more  often  than  not,  particularly  in  aggressive companies, people tend not to ask for enough help, rather than for too much.

Equally  important  is  knowing,  when  asked,  how  to  give  help. Those  who  don't  suffer  from  the  same  kind  of  deal  paranoia  that afflicts  the  Lone  Arranger.  People  who  are  reluctant  to  share  their knowledge, their contacts, their trade secrets with others within their own company are simply  not  going  to  have  a  very  strong  support system when they need one.

Your accepting help and your giving it are going to be remembered and acknowledged by any sort of enlightened management. There is nothing  wrong  with  self-interest,  even  selfish  interest.  In  fact,  the best  run  companies  all  seem  to  have  a  way  of  combining  selfinterest  with  corporate  interest.  But  acting  in  a  way  that sacrifices corporate  interest  for  self-interest  limits  your  effectiveness  and  will be noted.

## 'I WAS WRONG'

The chairman of a medium-sized company recently expressed to me his  frustrations  over  the  conservative  attitude  of  his  managementlevel employees. 'The problem,' he said, 'is that they're all afraid to make a mistake.'

There is  a  business  philosophy  I  subscribe  to  which  says  that  if you aren't making mistakes you aren't trying hard enough. I believe that to get ahead in business you have to be constantly testing the edge.  It  means  that  often  you  are  going  to  be  wrong.  The  good executives are right most of the time, but they also know why they are wrong and are not afraid to admit it.

The  people  who  are  least  secure  about  their  abilities  have  the hardest time admitting their mistakes. They fail to realize that making a mistake and admitting it - owning up to it - are two totally separate acts.  It  is  not  the  mistake  itself  but how a mistake is  handled that forms the lasting impression.

These  people  would  be  so  much  better  off,  and  would  look  so much  better  in  the  eyes  of  management,  if  they  could  admit  their mistakes and get on with it, rather than waste everyone's time trying to rationalize it, cover it up, or put the blame elsewhere.

I have seen some very capable executives get excited about their mistakes. They feel that by doing something wrong they may have learned something right, and can't wait to try again.

An ability to say 'I was wrong' is essential to success because it's cathartic. It allows these successful executives 'to get on with it', to put their mistakes behind them, and to move on to other things which may contribute to their next big success.

## Trust

Obviously, no employer would have anyone working for him whom he  didn't  trust.  But  I  think  in  any  company  there  are  certain employees  who  are  trusted  more  than  others  because  their judgement and character are so solid.

From  time  to  time  I  have  had  to  deal  with  the  problem  of employees who tend to 'fit' the facts into their version of reality, who tell  less  about  a  situation  than  they  actually  know  or  want  you  to know.

It's interesting to me how consistent these people are. If I suspect someone of being less than totally forthright, I will have one or two of his  expense  reports  sent  to  my  office.  Expense  reports  are  like  a truth serum.

Since  I  travel  about  300,000  miles  a  year,  I  have  a  pretty  good idea of what it costs to travel, and I would think this would be fairly obvious  to  those  who  work  for  us.  Yet  those  employees  I  suspect may be playing it a little too coy are invariably the ones who tend to broad-brush their  expense  numbers,  round  them  off  to  the  highest zero, and apparently take taxis back and forth several times before arriving at their destination.

I don't always bring these expense accounts up right away but will often deal with them subtly at salary review time.

Reading expense reports is another means of reading people. It is interesting  to  see  which  executives  must  always  stay  at  the  best hotels  and  eat  at  the  best  restaurants,  even  when  dining  alone.  It tells you something about the kind of ego trip they're on. Also, in our business,  where  glamorous  locales  are  more  the  rule  than  the exception,  you  can  tell  those  employees  who  plan  'business  trips' around  prearranged  vacations  and  those  who  take  some  pains  to avoid even the appearance of this.

People do not like to feel they are being conned, and no one is going  to  support  the  career  of  a  subordinate  who  is  a  little  too secretive, a little too clever for his or her own good. If you feel the only way to get ahead is to con the people you work for, then you'd better be very good at covering yourself, because over the long term there are so many different ways you can be found out.

## Loyalty

Loyalty is another form of trust. Employees often do not realize the importance  almost  any  company  places  on  it.  They  will  trade  off loyalty for a gain that is too small or a goal that is too short-sighted.

Obviously,  if  you  believe  another  company  is  about  to  make  an offer you can't refuse, you would be crazy not to pursue it. But if you do not intend to leave you have to be very careful about how to use other opportunities.

If  people don't like to be conned, they don't like to be threatened either.  Your threat of  looking  for  another  job  only  hurts  you.  You have, in effect, told your employer that you don't place much value on loyalty and, worse, that you don't even have anything to show for your attitude. You lose something important while gaining nothing. I have never been favourably impressed by someone telling me he is head-hunter bait.

If you do have another job offer, but would like to remain with the company you work for, stress the importance of your loyalty. Instead of saying, 'Look, they've offered me this. Either match it or top it or I'm out the door,' find out how much more effective it is to use slightly

different  words:  'Obviously,  this  is  where  my  loyalties  lie,  and  what can the company do so that I don't have to take this other job?'

## C.A.D.I.F.

Everyone has a boss, from the President of the United States, who can  be  fired  every  four  years,  to  the  chairman  of  the  board,  who must keep the stockholders or a parent company happy. And like it or not, your boss is judging you by these three criteria:

## COMMITMENT

If you feel anything less than total commitment to your job, don't let the boss in on your little secret.

## ATTENTION TO DETAIL

The big screw-ups get aired and thereby psychologically exorcized. It's the little ones, too minor to mention - a report that can't be found, a  failure  to  perform  a  little  chore  -  which  build  up  irritation  and resentment.

## IMMEDIATE FOLLOW-UP

As insignificant as this may seem, there is nothing that impresses so significantly.

## Don't Use The Office To Make Your Personal Statement

People are so career-minded today this is less of a problem than it used to be. But it still  angers me when any of our own executives use the office as some kind of personal forum.

This  can  involve  any  number  of  things,  from  the  way  someone dresses,  to  a  refusal  to  accept  or  participate  in  a  new  system because 'it's a waste of time', to setting his own hours, to catering to his own ego.

Self-assertion within the corporation is a very delicate thing. The trick is to conform - to know when to blend in - while sticking out at the same time.

Separate  personal  issues  from  corporate  or  substantive  issues. Assert yourself only when the time and place are appropriate.

## Don't Change The System: Work Through It

Companies never function  according  to  their  organizational  charts. They  are  made  up  of  people  and  personalities  and  politics  and power  plays,  none  of  which  can  be  connected  by  solid  or  dotted lines.

It is important to know the system so that you can work through it. Too many people spend too much time fighting against the system. The best and brightest spend their time learning how to use it.

Every company has its secret organizational chart, and the system itself  is  the  best  clue  to  figuring  out  what  it  is.  Understand  how  it's supposed  to  work,  and  you  will  begin  to  understand  how  it really works.  Who  are  the  decision  makers?  Who's  hot  and  who's  not? What  are  the  short  cuts  and  where  are  the  back  doors?  How  do things really get done?

I don't think you have to play politics in order to get ahead. Have you ever noticed that the people who complain about office politics are always its victims? But I do think you have to make some friends. In fact, this is essential. In order to be effective you have to develop lasting  relationships  inside  the  company  as  well  as  outside.  The bigger the company, the more important this becomes.

Again,  see  your  peers  as  your  allies,  not  as  your  competition.  If you can hitch your wagon to a few of your company's brightest stars, you will climb right up the ladder with them.

On Making It Easy On Yourself By Making It Easy On Others

We  had  an  executive  in  New  York  who  was  always  complaining about our legal department in Cleveland. He maintained that the time it took  to  draft  or  sign  off  on  his  contracts  was  hurting  his effectiveness. I knew the situation and he was probably right, but he failed  to  appreciate  that  our  legal  department  had  its  own  set  of priorities, and that he might not always be at the top of their list. In fact, by ranting and raving all the time he virtually guaranteed that he would not be.

One  day  the  head  of  our  legal  department  took  this  executive aside and said, 'Let me show you how to work with your lawyer. The next  time  a  contract  comes  in,  review  it  yourself,  and  then,  before sending it off,  attach  a  covering  memo that lists  any  problems you see  and  how  you  might  recommend  fixing  them.  Let's  see  if  this speeds things up. If it doesn't, we'll try something else.'

Needless to say, there was never a need to try something else.

When you need something from another department, ask yourself, 'What  can  I  do  to  make  it  easier  for  them?'  If  you  need  sales information, don't insist on speaking only to the sales manager; find out from him whom you can call. If you have a problem with another department,  make  sure  they  are  aware  of  the  problem  before  you demand an answer. Show people in other departments that you want to  work  with  them,  instead  of  conveying  the  attitude  that  somehow they work for you. You will find that when you need that peer-group support, it will be there.

## Pick Your Shots

The quickest way to lose credibility is to rage about minor offences because of a build-up over major ones. This is the corporate version of getting a divorce because your spouse squeezes toothpaste from the middle of the tube. We're all susceptible to it, but it also shows immaturity  and  reveals  lack  of  good  judgement.  Moreover,  most companies  don't  have  the  time  to  psychoanalyse  you  to  find  out where the real problems lie.

When you join a new company at any level, the job comes with a certain amount of chips. Your judgement as to when - and over what

-  to  use  these  chips  will  either  add  to  your  winnings  or  send  you looking for another game.

## Pick Your Spots

Your  effectiveness  in  a  company  is  directly  proportionate  to  your ability  to  leverage  yourself:  'How  and  where  can  I  make  the  most impact  in  the  least  amount  of  time?'  Yet  many  people  in  business seem  preoccupied  by  a  fear  of  being  left  out.  If  a  committee  is formed  they  want  to  be  on  it;  if  a  meeting  is  called  they  want  to attend  it.  I  once  arranged  to  have  lunch  in  New  York  with  several executives whom I had not seen in a while. I later discovered this innocent get together had become known as the 'lunch committee', and several executives were actually upset that they had not been 'appointed' to it!

Intra-corporate  cosmetics  is  an  undeniable  fact  of  corporate  life. And  while  committees  and  meetings  do  contribute  to  corporate visibility,  you  have to pick your spots. Leverage your attendance at meetings  and  your  appointments  to  committees.  Look  for  those where  you  can  gain  the  most  and  avoid  those  where  you  can contribute the least. When I see the same face popping up at every meeting, I start to wonder when that particular executive has time to get anything else done.

## What Do You Do Beyond Your Job Description?

The projects people take on which are not part of their day-to-day job description,  which  have  not  been  assigned  to  them,  are  those projects for which people get the most credit and recognition.

The jobs most people have existed before they got there and will continue to exist after they've left. The job is the constant. What you do  by  going  beyond  it  is  what  gets  noticed.  Most  positions  in  a company are three-quarters functional, meaning the set responsibilities  and  duties  that  came  with  it,  and  one-quarter

personal style. The degree to which you can stretch this 25% is the degree by which you will stand out in your company.

## What Are You Doing Here And What Do Others Think You Are Doing Here?

Several years ago, we gave one of our executives the new top-level position of Chief Financial Officer of our overall group of companies. A month or so after the appointment, I called the executive about a fairly  urgent  matter  and  was  told  he  was  in  Pittsburgh  for  the  day seeing a Mr Rogers.

Pittsburg?  I  could  not  recall  our  having  any  banking  or  financial commitments in Pittsburg. Mr Rogers? The name didn't ring a bell, but we deal with hundreds of financial people, and it wasn't likely that it would.

When I spoke to the executive later that day he told me that his meeting  with  Mr  Rogers  had  gone  very  well.  I  asked  him  who  Mr Rogers was and he said, 'You know, the guy who wears a sweater and has a TV programme for kids.'

I  had  to  wonder  what  my  Chief  Financial  Officer  was  doing  in Pittsburgh signing up Mr Rogers. In fairness, part of the executive's former  responsibilities  had  included  the  licensing  of  children's products and apparel. While I thought it was fairly obvious that his new  position  was  a  full-time  job,  apparently  this  had  been  less obvious to him.

This  is  a  fairly  extreme  example  but  the  simple  truth  is  that  the vast majority of people working in your company have absolutely no idea  what  you  do  there  and  the  rest  are  labouring  under misconceptions.  If  you  were  to  write  out  what  you  do  for  the company  and  your  immediate  superior  was  to  write  out  what  he thought you did for the company, you would probably be amazed by the discrepancy.

Why is  this  important?  What  difference  does  it  make?  First,  the classic corporate 'failure to communicate' begins at this level. I once heard  someone  use  what  I  thought  was  a  wonderful  line  in describing  the  feelings  that  many  people  have  about  their

companies:  'Their  insanity  becomes  your  reality.'  If  you  and  your boss are labouring under different assumptions about your goals and priorities, is it any wonder that you are often mystified by some of the decisions that get made and the failure of others to see what may be perfectly clear to you?

Second,  on  the  more  direct  subject  of  advancement,  you  are probably being judged by certain criteria that would be news to you. And you are probably making certain contributions to your company that would be news to them, which is a big reason people fail to get recognition.

Compare notes with your boss. What does he think you are doing here, and what do others think you are doing here? Once you can agree on the 'givens', you will be less shocked by the assumptions.

## Don't Go One-By-One With The Boss

If  you win the battle you're probably going to lose the war. And the more right you are, the more damage it will probably do in the long run.

We had a situation several years ago where one of our employees got into a heated exchange with his boss. One thing led to another, and he was asked to resign.

This was a very unfortunate situation, and the employee asked to see me because he felt that once I knew all the circumstances of the dispute I might be willing to prevail upon his boss to reconsider.

I  told  the employee that I would be happy to listen but that there was nothing I could do, because my larger priority was supporting the management structure of the company. No matter how wrong or intemperate his boss might have been, that, unfortunately, was now a non-issue.

The situation did not reflect well on this particular employee's boss - but his boss still had a job.

## No-Wins

The people who buy new companies are rarely the people who have to  go  in  and  run  them.  But  if  you're  the  one  they  turn  to  for  help, make sure you're not entering a no-win situation.

## 'WE'VE JUST BOUGHT THIS COMPANY AND WE'D LIKE YOU TO RUN IT …'

You  can't  stop  your  company  from  making  stupid  acquisitions  or getting involved in businesses they shouldn't be in. But you can try to avoid becoming part of a team that's going to 'continue its success' or turn it around. For, more often than not, you will find yourself in a no-win situation.

A  company  is  usually  bought  for  one  of  two  reasons:  either because it is successful - which means the best you can do is make it  slightly better - or because it is unsuccessful and the buyer feels he can turn it around.

There are always hidden reasons, as well as the obvious ones, as to  why  a  company  is  unsuccessful.  Sometimes  you  know  all  the problems  and  what  can  be  done  about  them,  but  this  kind  of foreknowledge  is  rare.  Usually  it  is  not  until  you  have  already committed  yourself  and  are  in  position  that  you  discover  the  real problems and whether they are correctable. Moreover, if  you  have taken  on  a  management  position  in  a  business  you  know  nothing about, you start with a strike against you. Your efforts are going to be resented by employees who do know the business even if they aren't very capable of running it.

## 'IT MAY SEEM LIKE A LATERAL MOVE BUT …'

Versions  of  this  exist  up  and  down  the  corporate  structure.  The lateral shift, particularly if you suspect the skills involved are not your strong suit, presents a two-pronged problem. Either the new division is already well run, which means you will never get any credit, or it's poorly run, in which case your effectiveness is probably going to be limited by those above you.

## 'WE'VE CREATED THIS NEW POSITION ESPECIALLY FOR YOU …'

The job doesn't make much sense to you, and you aren't really sure it  will  work  in  practice  the  way  it  sounds  in  theory,  but  the  pay  is better and it's more responsibility … Watch out.

'THIS JOB REALLY REQUIRES THE SPECIAL TALENT OF SOMEONE LIKE YOU'

Beware of any position with a long list of dead bodies attached to it. It's  best  to  talk  to  a  few  of  the  dead  bodies  before  jumping into an open grave.

## Get Into The International Division

If I were offered any job I wanted in a company, and if I didn't know the company that well, I would ask to head the International Division. All  else  being  equal,  this  is  where  I  could  probably  make  the  most impact in the least amount of time.

You can count on your fingers the American companies which are maximizing their full potential in international markets.

Of all the world's companies, American-run businesses are by far the  most  arrogant  and  chauvinistic.  Most  of  their  international divisions haven't taken the time to break down language and cultural barriers, preferring to declare them impenetrable.

There are eight billion people out there and fewer than 3% of them live  in  the  United  States.  Get  into  your  company's  international division. You can go a long way just raking the cream off the top.

## Burn-Out And Boredom

Psychologists  would  probably  tell  me  I  am  a  prime  candidate  for burn-out:  I  work  too  hard  and  too  long  under  extremely  stressful conditions.  Yet  I  have  never  experienced  anything  close  to  what must be a terrible psychological state.

I  do,  however,  take  precautions.  I  schedule  time  for  exercise, relaxation and rest, including naps in the office, and I observe those time  commitments  just  as  I  would  any  other  business  time commitments.  I  have  learned  to  compartmentalize  my  business emotions as well as my business day. I write everything down, and since I put my notes where they will pop up again in the right place at the right time, once I have written something down I forget about it.

The end result is that when I break from work, I break from workrelated stress as well.

I  think  a  far  more  pervasive  problem  than  job  burn-out  is  job boredom.  I've  never  experienced  extended  periods  of  boredom either, though like everyone else I go through a trough now and then.

Boredom  occurs  when  the  learning  curve  flattens  out.  It  can happen to anyone at any level of the corporation. In fact, it occurs most  often  in  successful  people  who  need  more  challenge  and stimulation than do others.

One of the sure signs of incipient boredom is knowing your job too well, or knowing all the right buttons to push. I simply will not allow this to happen to myself.

I find that I am redefining my job all the time, taking on new tasks, or  constantly  creating  new  challenges  for  myself.  If  I  reach  some goal, either personally or corporately, that goal immediately becomes a step in the learning process towards another more ambitious goal.

This,  I  believe,  is  how  people  grow  in  their  jobs,  and  grow  in importance to their company.

If you're bored it's your fault. You just aren't working hard enough at  making  your  job  interesting.  It  is  also  probably  the  reason  you haven't been offered anything better.

Find out what you love to do and you will be successful at it.

Since  I  still  get  up  at  four  or  five  every  morning  and  still  put  in eighty to ninety hours a week, even though I really don't have to any more,  one  of  the  first  things  I  am  usually  asked  by  reporters  and interviewers is, 'Why do you keep pushing yourself so hard?'

I  always wish I had a better answer to give them, but the simple truth is all I can come up with: 'I love what I do.'

## What You Can Learn From Working In The Mail Room

You won't learn humility. You won't learn respect. You won't learn the company inside  out  or  from  the  bottom  up.  What  you  will  learn  is something  very  important,  and  perhaps  a  bit  frightening,  about yourself.

The people who get ahead have a need, are driven to perform a task well, no matter what the task is or how mundane it may actually be. They bring to any job an attitude which actually transforms the job  into  something  greater.  Carpenters  who  become  contractors  at one time had a need to drive a nail straighter and truer than anyone else. Waiters who end up owning restaurants were at one time very good waiters.

Some executives, had they started in the mail room, would still be sorting mail - and misrouting most of it.

## Part Two Sales and Negotiation

## The Problem of Selling

Most  people,  I  believe,  are  born  salesmen.  At  school,  we  sell  our peers on accepting us and our teachers on giving us good grades. We try to sell our parents on letting us stay out at night or on using the car or on buying a new stereo.

Unconsciously, we are already employing many of the aspects of selling: powers of persuasion; the art of negotiation; and the ultimate teenager's tactic - 'Never take 'no' for an answer.'

By the time we get to the outside world we have learned how to position ourselves to get what we want, how to market our abilities and how to sell ourselves on job interviews.

Then something happens. We forget how to sell. We question our own sales aptitude. Suddenly the techniques we've used all our lives become foreign  and  mysterious,  as  though  we  now  had  to  go  out and learn them for the first time.

And yet the art of selling is the conscious practice of a lot of things we  already  know unconsciously -  and  have  probably  spent  the better part of our lives doing.

The problem is  that  once  we  enter  the  real  world  of  business  a new factor emerges. For the first time our powers of persuasion, our sales abilities, are being judged. This can be intimidating, and so we respond by convincing ourselves that we can't sell, we don't know how  to  sell,  or  we  don't  want  to  sell.  We  then  use  these  mental roadblocks to justify our lack of sales aptitude.

But the real problems of selling have little to do with aptitude and almost everything to do with how we perceive the process of selling itself. Some people find it beneath them, others find it intrusive. And almost all of us fear the rejection.

## Selling Doesn't Seem Important Enough

One of the biggest problems that people have with selling is that it seems less important than it did twenty years ago. Historically, the quickest  way  to  the  top  was  through  sales.  These  days  selling  is perceived as one of the lesser business skills, conjuring up images of Willie Loam and the Fuller Brush man. People are more likely to believe  that  the  quickest  way  to  the  top  is  through  management training. There  is  some  truth  to  this,  but  to  presume  that management skills obviate the need for sales skills is a dangerous form of self-deception. I have yet to meet a chairman or a CEO of a major  corporation  who  didn't  pride  himself  on  his  powers  of persuasion - or, in other words, his salesmanship.

Selling is what they don't teach you at Harvard Business School. Business  schools  admit  that  their  purpose  is  to  train  managers, thereby almost totally overlooking the fact that if there are no sales there  is  nothing  to  manage.  This  escapes  a  lot  of  newly  minted MBAs,  who  in  their  desire  to  run  a  company  may  find  sales,  the techniques involved, the art of selling, beneath them.

We have had many MBAs work for our company, and I have found their  lack  of  sales  skills  to  be  the  biggest  gap  in  their  business knowledge. Fortunately, most of them learned to sell through on-thejob  experience.  But  I  have  seen  many  MBAs  at  other  companies who haven't, who persist in believing that an understanding of selling is not really a fundamental requisite of management-level personnel. This is sometimes called 'lacking the common touch'. I think it's more aptly described as lacking common sense.

I  was  amused  recently  by  an  article  in  the New  York  Times on Morgan Stanley & Company, the aristocratic investment banking firm which  hires  only  the  top  MBAs.  Morgan  Stanley  had  beaten  out twelve  other  firms  in  vying  for  the  right  to  manage  the  Teamsters Union's $4.7 billion pension fund. Here's what the Times had to say.

'At one of their meetings with a committee of Teamsters trustees union  men  and  trucking  executives  -  part  of  the  session  was devoted  to  the  Morgan  officers'  individual  backgrounds,  with  the emphasis on humble origins.

'One  executive  said  that  a  scholarship  put  him  through  college. Another  pointed  out  that  he  had  joined  the  Marine  Corps  directly after school. And a third told the trustees sitting across the table that he  had  grown  up  in  a  modest  household,  the  son  of  a  railroad engineer.  So  it  went  as  each  of  a  dozen  or  more  Morgan  officials took his turn.

'It was is if they said, 'I know we have this portrait of J. P. Morgan up on the wall, but we're really regular guys,' said one participant, who asked not to be named.'

Anyone who can convince the Teamsters that J. P. Morgan was, at heart, a union man, understands the importance of selling.

## Selling Is An Intrusion

People  hate  to  impose,  to  make  waves.  Have  you  ever  found yourself  nodding  in  agreement  to  something  with  which  you  totally disagree? Have you ever thought about sending back an overdone steak, then changed your mind?

A feeling that selling is intrusive is not a problem. It is an asset. The best salesmen all seem to have a sixth sense about this. They can  tell  by  the  tone  in  someone's  voice  or  the  atmosphere  in  the room when the mood or timing is wrong. And either because they don't want to impose, or because they know that it is not in their own best  interests  to  do  so,  they  will  not  antagonize  their  customer  by attempting to make a sale.

The  old  foot-in-the-door  school  of  high-pressure,  super-assertive techniques has gone the way of the dinosaur. These were never very effective techniques to begin with, but perhaps they were necessary fifty years ago when a salesman was not likely to see or speak to a customer  for  another  six  months.  Today  in  the  age  of  modern communication  and  transportation,  if  you  are  being  intrusive  and have enough people-awareness to sense this, there is no excuse for your not picking a better time and coming back. You do, of course, have to be willing to come back again.

Effective selling is directly tied to timing, patience and persistence - and to sensitivity to the situation and the person with whom you

are  dealing.  An  awareness  of  when  you  are  imposing  can  be  the most important personal asset a salesman can have.

It also helps to believe in your product. When I feel that what I am selling is really right for someone, that it simply makes sense for this particular customer, I never feel I am imposing. I feel that I am doing him a favour.

## Fear

Fear is the single biggest problem people have with selling: fear of rejection, fear of failure.

So  much  of  selling  a  product,  a  service,  anything,  is  selling yourself, putting your own ego on the line. And what are the odds? If you're  pretty  good,  you're  probably  going  to  fail  half  the  time. Rejection, as they say, comes with the territory.

Rejection  in  selling  is  rarely  personal,  but  simply  knowing  this doesn't make it any easier to take. I have always found that it helps not  to  be  too  'adult'  about  it.  Learning  to  accept  rejection  doesn't mean having to like it. Acknowledge your real feelings and if those real feelings are irritation, frustration or anger, admit to them instead of pretending they don't exist.

I've  been rejected hundreds of times. Yet tomorrow, if I've put in the  effort,  and  if  what  I'm  selling  makes  sense  and  if  I  get  turned down, I'm going to be frustrated or  angry  all  over  again.  Realizing that it isn't personal doesn't mean you shouldn't take it personally. If you  don't,  in  fact,  it  may  mean  that  you  haven't  put  enough  of yourself into the effort.

Fear  of  failure  is  another  problem  that  people  have  with  selling. Sales  results  are  so  tangible,  so  measurable  in  black  and  white, there is no place to run or hide.

But what many people don't appreciate is that fear of failure is one of the greatest positive motivators in business. If you aren't afraid to fail, then you probably don't care enough about success.

Björn Borg had a reputation for being an iceman on the court. But he  once  told  me  that  on  key  points  he  was  always  terrified,  that

sometimes it would take all the courage he could muster just to put the ball in play.

This  was  true  as  well  of  Arnold  Palmer,  and  I  believe  this  very human quality had more to do with his enormous popularity than all the tournaments he won. His fear of failure was so strong because his  desire  for  success was so great. And when he failed, when he missed a shot, you could see the pain etched on his face, and you knew he cared.

## 6 Timing

Many ideas fail not because they are bad ideas, nor because they are poorly executed, but because the timing is not correct.

Some years ago we were involved in trying to establish a pro golf circuit  in  South  America.  We  encountered  all  sorts  of  unforeseen problems,  ranging  from  sudden  currency  devaluation,  which undercut our cash-flow, to spiralling inflation which made the costs of continuing the tour prohibitive.

Our timing couldn't have been worse, and it cost us a lot of money to find this out. But we also found out that South Americans love golf. And  so  we  are  convinced  that  one  day,  given  the  right circumstances,  this  particular  concept  will  work  and,  when  it  does, I'm sure we will be the ones who will make it work.

A  lot  of  salespeople  are  far  too  quick  to  write  off  a  good  idea simply  because  their  timing  was  bad.  If  someone  says  'no'  to  a project or an idea, it is not always because he doesn't like the idea or the project. It may be simply that for economic reasons or for other internal reasons you don't know about, it simply doesn't work for that particular person at that particular moment.

Yet  weeks,  months,  even  years  later,  you  will  hear  'So-and-so doesn't  like  that  project,'  or  'Such-and-such  company  has  already said 'no' to that,' or 'They don't have the money for it.'

## Go Back In Five Years

If  you  believe  in  an  idea,  and  if  you  believe  that  the  idea  should make sense for a particular customer, go back again. I can't tell you how many times I've  seen  an  idea  bear  fruit  when  it  is  presented again at a more auspicious moment.

The  simple  movement  of  a  clock,  the  flipping  of  a  calendar  can totally alter the dynamics of a selling situation and the receptivity of the buyer,

Shortly  after  Bob  Anderson  became  Chairman  of  Rockwell International,  I  suggested  that  he  hire  our  company  to  produce  an internal  promotional  film  in  which  Anderson  would  visit  various Rockwell sites and explain their role in the overall operation of the company. We had done this kind of thing before, and we knew it was an  effective  device  for  promoting  a  family  feeling  in  multinational companies separated by great geographical distances.

'Mark,'  Anderson  said,  'I  just  took  over  this  job  from  the  man whose  name  is  still  on  the  door  of  this  company.  The  last  thing I should be doing now is commissioning and starring in a promotional film - but try me again in five years.'

Almost  exactly  five  years  later,  I  did  just  that.  And  Rockwell  is considering now a commitment of the necessary funds.

## The Secret Life Of A Deal

Timing has any number of direct applications to selling. It can govern anything from the time span over which a sale is made, to when in a particular conversation to say something, to when under a particular set of circumstances to do something.

Timing itself is not pragmatic. It is not a precept or a set of rules that can be followed, but a percept - sensory signals that are picked up by the brain and then applied to the selling situation.

When  you  combine  the  perceptory  nature  of  time  with  all  the timing  intangibles  of  selling  -  how  long  an  idea  should  germinate, when to make a particular phone call, etc. - correct or appropriate timing is almost always a judgement call.

What this means is that those people who seem to be blessed with an innate sense of good timing are really those people who are most sensitively  attuned  -  to  themselves,  to  their  customers,  and  to  the selling  situation  itself.  Almost  any  deal,  whether  it's  a  simple transaction  or  a  complex  series  of  manoeuvres  covering  several

years, gives off its own unique sensory signals, which are there for anyone to pick up.

## LISTEN TO YOUR COMMON SENSE

The objective facts of a sale - its nature, its complexity, the people to whom you are selling,  and  certain  information  you  learn  along  the way  -  can  tell  you  most  of  what  you  need  to  know  about  timing. Apply this information with common sense. Do the obvious when you should  obviously  do  it,  and  don't  do  anything  when  you  obviously shouldn't.

If your customer doesn't know you or your company, it is obvious that  a  sale  will  take  longer  than  if  he  does.  If  the  buyer  is underwhelmed by your initial presentation, it's obvious you'd better take the time to exchange some ideas before presenting it again. If you  know  the  buyer's  selling-in  process  will  take  several  months, don't try to force a commitment out of him after several weeks.

Recently, I received a call from a company that was looking to buy a sports concept tailored to a very specific set of promotional needs. As it turned out, just the week before I had seen a concept from our Tennis Division which, with a couple of minor variations, was exactly what this particular company was looking for. (This, by the way, is an example neither of good nor of bad timing, but of fortuitous  timing, which  is  totally  beyond  the  seller's  control  but  which  everyone deserves now and then.)

I told the person who had called that I would like to think about it, that I wanted to talk to some of our people, and that I would get back to him in exactly two weeks.

Even though I knew we had what he wanted, it was obvious to me that if our concept was to look inspired, I had to allow some time to pass between his problem and our solution. If I called him back the next  day,  he  would  wonder  just  how  much  brilliant  conceptual thinking had actually taken place. But by giving him a precise time when I would be calling, he would not only wait for the call; he would be anxious to hear from me.

A  good  general  common  sense  rule  of  timing  is:  don't  blurt  out anything. Take a moment to consider whether the situation demands

a certain timing strategy or if you can use timing to your advantage. If it doesn't, and if you can't, you can always call right back.

## LISTEN TO THE BUYER

The salesman controls the timing of a sale,  but  he  takes  his  cues from the buyer. Obviously this places a premium on listening rather than  talking,  on  really  hearing  what  the  buyer  is  telling  you  rather than paying it 'ear service'.

You  can  pick  up  a  lot  of  timing  clues  just  by  asking  the  right questions. Many companies, for instance, because of budgeting and other considerations, are more receptive to buying at certain times of the year than at others. This kind of information is usually available for the asking.

And if you know the buyer well, if you've taken the time to make him  a  friend,  he  will  give  you  good  timing  cues  -  when  to  initiate; when  to  close;  whom  to  call  and  when  -  throughout  the  selling process.

## FOLLOW THE SCRIPT

The timing of a sale can be as central to getting a commitment as what  is  actually  said  and  done.  If  all  the  selling  variables  that determine  timing  had  to  be  separately  weighed  and  analytically considered,  the  correct  timing  'answers'  to  even  the  simplest transactions would require several computers.

Fortunately,  the  mind  does  this  for  you.  It  computes  through sensory  perceptions  what  could  never  be  arrived  at  through analytical  thought.  Timing,  then,  is  a  matter  of  converting  these sensory  perceptions  into  conscious  actions  or  conscious  inactions (when not to say and do certain things).

This process is easier if you envisage the time frame as the 'life span' of a deal, or as separate from the deal itself, a third party to the transaction.  Most  deals  seem to have a secret life which follows a kind  of  pre-ordained  script.  Anyone  who  has  ever  'killed  one'  by closing  too  quickly  or  too  late,  by  shortening  or  extending  a  sale beyond its 'natural life' would probably attest to this.

A  single  selling  situation  may  require  anywhere  from  several seconds to several years. Obviously the more complex the deal and

the more phases it has, the more important it is to picture this script in  your  mind,  to  attune  yourself  to  a  deal's  separate  or  secret  life. The  timing  for  each  phase  -  when  and  for  how  long  -  is  already typed out like stage directions. Correct timing - converting sensory perception into appropriate conscious actions - is a matter of seeing the script and following it.

Many  people,  once  they  see  the  script  in  their  minds,  have  an overwhelming need to depart from it. In their haste to make a deal, they want to compress the time frame or cut directly to Act III. They want to rewrite the dialogue or eliminate the buyer's lines altogether. They see the signs for appropriate timing, but ignore them, and fail to properly massage the situation. By rewriting the script they give it an unhappy ending.

## Instant Gratification

We are all pulled by the urge for instant gratification, and everything about the corporate environment seems to increase this urge. Get it out of the way. Go on to the next thing. One less ball up in the air means one less thing to worry about.

But even if we can make people do what we want them to do, we can  rarely  make  them  do  it  when  we  want  them  to.  People  and events move at their own pace and almost never go according to our own  timetable.  One  of  the  surest  signs  of  business  maturity  is  an ability to postpone instant gratification, to adjust your own timetable to suit others.

As  both  a  salesman  and  someone  who  runs  a  company,  I  can think  of  no  aspect  of  timing  that  is  more  important  than  patience. Lack  of  patience  alone  is  enough  to  blow  a  deal,  while  the application  of  it  -  letting  someone  ramble  on  philosophically  while waiting  out  a  particular  situation  -  can  singlehandedly  turn  a  deal around.

I  would  guess  that  more  deals  are  blown  because  of  lack  of patience than for almost any other reason. I see or hear examples of this almost every week:

- A salesman, on the phone, sensing the other party is harried or in an irritable mood, delivers his sales pitch anyway.
- A salesman, asked by a buyer to come back again, says, 'But this will only take a minute.'
- A salesman, while shaking hands on a deal, says to the buyer, 'Now that that's out of the way, I've really got something to talk to you about.'

If congenital bad timing is a disease, then patience is probably the cure.

## Persistence

Persistence,  as  conventionally  understood,  implies  that  selling  is strictly a numbers game, a question of how many doors you knock on and how many times you go back to knock again.

I  doubt  that  this  is  the  whole  story  in  any  sales  business.  In  our organization, and I'm sure this is true of most service organizations, effective selling is as much a matter of the quality of the doors, and how and when you choose to knock, as it is of numbers.

But this is not to undermine the importance of persistence. Without the patience to wait and the persistence to go back again, any other insights into timing aren't worth very much. Persistence is certainly right  up  there,  among  the  basic  sales  commandments,  with  'know your product' and 'believe in your product'.

Ray Kroc, founder and for many years Chairman of McDonald's, was a fifty-year-old  milk-shake  salesman  when  he  opened  his  first restaurant. Ray believed in persistence. In fact, he had a plaque on his office wall which described his feeling:

Nothing in the world can take the place of persistence. Talent will not; nothing is more common than unsuccessful men with talent. Genius will not; unrewarded genius is almost a proverb.

Education will not; the world is full of educated derelicts. Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent.

## Take Advantage Of Timing Opportunities

There are any number of timing opportunities that drop in your lap. While you don't have to be a fortune teller to spot them, you do have to be sensitively attuned to their significance to tailor events to your advantage.

## HOW TO EXTEND OR RENEW A CONTRACT

Extend, renew or renegotiate a contract when the other party is the happiest , not when the contract is about to expire. Whenever we've done an exceptional deal for a client, I encourage the executive in charge  to  discuss  extending  the  client's  representation  agreement then, even if it still has a year or so to run.

If  a  customer  of  yours  has  received  terrific  news, even  if  it  has nothing to do with your product - a raise or a bonus, for instance there's probably a good timing opportunity there.

Take automatic mood checks. Mood alone can turn a 'yes' into a 'no' and vice versa.

## TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE BAD TIMING OF OTHERS

The  bad  or  unfortunate  timing  of  others  can  create  all  sorts  of opportunities  for  you.  You  often  see  this  in  an  election  year,  with each candidate being very cautious about when to throw his or her hat  into  the  ring.  Each  is  waiting  for  the  others  to  make  a  political blunder, so that he can then ride in as the white knight.

Just  as  you  should  renew  a  contract  when  the  client  is  the happiest,  sell  one  when  the  prospective  buyer  is  unhappiest  with your competition.

Our  television  division  was  recently  seeking  to  represent  world rights  to  a  major  sporting  event.  At  the  time,  these  rights  were controlled  by  one  of  the  American  networks.  We  learned,  shortly

after the event organizers did, that this network had recently sold a package of their lesser sports properties to a particular country, with the major sporting event included as the 'prize'.

The organizers were very upset at having been used this way and, since they had already experienced problems with the network, I felt our  timing  might  be  pretty  good:  we  now  represent  this  particular event.

## WEIGH THE PRESENT AGAINST THE FUTURE

When Tony Jacklin won the British Open in 1969, he was inundated by endorsement opportunities, particularly from England, which had been waiting a long time for its own golf champion. We felt, however, that Jacklin's win was no accident, and so we agreed only to shortterm  contracts,  one  year  or  less.  A  year  later,  Jacklin  won  the  US Open and his endorsement value tripled.

Conversely, when Ben Crenshaw first turned pro, I felt he had one of  the  most  promotable  images  I  had  seen  in  pro  sports.  He  was being  touted  as  the  'next  Nicklaus',  and  while  that  is  a  nice reputation to have, it was next to impossible to live up to. I felt it was important  to  promote  Crenshaw's  image  before  it  was  associated with  any  success  he  might  or  might  not  have  on  the  golf  course. Unfortunately,  Ben  waited  too  long,  and  by  the  time  we  began representing him the fact that he was something less than immortal hurt his marketability.

When Muhammad Ali was at the peak of his fame, the climate of the country simply was not as favourable for a black athlete as it was for a white one. It is now, and even back then you could see it was going  to  change.  Had  Ali  worked  on  developing  a  positive, wholesome, 'non-boxer' image, he could have made as much out of the ring as he did in it. But he never weighed the present in terms of the  future,  and  his  revenues  from  endorsements  have  never amounted to much.

## TAKE ADVANTAGE OF A SETTING SUN

Pat  Ryan,  the  Managing  Editor  of People magazine,  told  me  of  a selling  pointer  that  her  father,  the  late  Irish  horseman,  Jim  Ryan, passed  on  to  many  of  today's  race-trackers.  Always  ask  a

prospective  horse  buyer  around  in  the  late  afternoon  for  tea  or  a drink. Sociability is not the point, but instead the fact that there is no better  moment  to  show  a  horse  than  in  the  setting  sun.  His  coat gleams,  he  looks  full  of  life,  unbeatable.  (This  is  the  same  reason that Sports lllustrated 's bathing-suit issues are always photographed at sunrise or sunset.)

Few people are likely to require a sunset as a sales backdrop, but it  is  a  certainty  that  sellers  can  take  timing  advantage  of  future events that are as inevitable as a setting sun.

One  of  our  most  successful  television productions, 'The Superstars', which has been on ABC-TV for a decade now, was sold in  part  because  it  responded  to  a  certain  timing  inevitability  -  the network's need to fill the winter sports trough between football and baseball.  The  new  football  league  may  change  this,  but  for  the present  (and  for  the  past  ten  years)  there  has  been  an  obvious predictability to this need.

## THE CALENDAR IS LOADED

Dates are what turn timing into concrete information. A calendar, in the hands of the right salesman, can be a potential sales weapon. In our business, for instance, we know that, world politics aside, there is a certain inevitability to a 1988, 1992 and 1996 Olympics. We can begin  timing  certain  sales  efforts  towards  these  particular  future events.

Many of our sales efforts, in fact, are timed to take advantage of major annual sports events, either to tie in with them or to use them as a medium for customer entertainment.

Several years ago when California's Tax Reform Act, Proposition Thirteen, was big news, I heard the story of how one gentleman, who was a professional lecturer on finance, took advantage of what the calendar told him about future opportunities. Several weeks before the proposition was to be voted on, he reserved a full-page ad in the Los Angeles Times which ran the day after the proposition passed. The ad, announcing his new lecture series, was headlined, 'How You Can Profit From Proposition Thirteen'.

COMING IN AND GOING OUT

The best person to sell to is someone who has just arrived at a new company  or  is  just  leaving.  When  John  DeLorean  was  leaving Pontiac he called me and said, 'Mark, as soon as I get out of here, they're  going  to  try  to  undo  everything  I've  done.  If  you  want  to extend the Nicklaus agreement, we better do it now.'

A newly arrived executive is anxious to do something, to make his mark,  and  he  is  usually  given  enough  rope.  An  executive  who  is about to leave - and knows he won't be around for the headaches doesn't care.

We've  concluded  deals  because  someone  was  tying  up  loose ends  before  he  walked  out  the  door,  and  because  he'd  like  to  do business with us in his new job.

## WHEN YOUR TIMING IS CONSIDERATE, LET THE OTHER PARTY KNOW

For example, 'I knew about this last week, but I didn't want to bother you during the sales conference (before the holidays, while you were working on your budget, etc.).' As a general rule, avoid making any phone  calls  (particularly  if  it's  bad  news  or  about  a  problem)  on Monday mornings or Friday afternoons.

## USE (WITH EXTREME CAUTION) INCONSIDERATE TIMING

A phone call in non-business hours, late at night or over a weekend, always has greater impact. If you're smart about it, you can use it to great advantage, but you'd better know what you're doing because it can  easily  backfire.  Always  set  it  up  first:  'This  is  so  good  (or  so important) I'd like to talk to you about it over the weekend.'

## DON'T GIVE DEADLINES

Sometimes, giving a buyer a deadline is unavoidable. But a deadline is a threat, and people who feel they are being threatened will go out of their way to call you on it. Deadlines should only be invoked as a last-gasp measure.

The quickest way to lose credibility is to give someone an absolute deadline then extend it, amend it or ignore it. This is the corporate version  of  crying  wolf.  Once  you've  failed  to  observe  your  own deadline, everything else you say will be taken with a pinch of salt.

## TAKE TIME TO SOFTEN A THREAT

Timing can be used to soften the demand for a decision. If you doubt the  sincerity  of  a  'maybe',  give  someone  a  plausible  time  conflict which demands resolution.

I recently felt we were being strung along by a company that had originally indicated a definite desire to proceed. The deal involved a major time commitment of a top-ranked woman tennis player.

Giving them a deadline would have been too threatening. Instead we indicated that if we did not have an answer within the next week it would become much more difficult, and perhaps impossible for us to cancel some of her tournament commitments.

As it  turned  out,  the  answer  was  a  negative  but  it  was  better  to know this than to have it drag out indefinitely. By suggesting a time conflict  we  forced  the  issue  without  making  it  sound  like  take-it-orleave-it.

## ATTENTION SPANS

Busy people have short attention spans, so get to the point. Assume that you are there to listen and you'll talk less. Don't start with your life  story;  don't  drag  out  a  presentation;  and,  unless  you're  a playwright, forget the dramatic build-up. All you'll succeed in doing is irritating  people  or,  worse,  making  their  minds  wander.  Also,  learn the attention spans of the people you deal with. I know, for instance, in dealing with Bob Anderson of Rockwell that if I'm on any subject more than forty-five seconds his mind is going to be off on something else.

## SHOPPING LISTS

If you have more than one subject to discuss, make sure you reserve enough time for the most important of them. Never place yourself in the position of having to ask, 'Could I have a few more minutes? I haven't got to my main idea yet.'

## GIVE SOMEONE THE GIFT OF TIME

One of the best ways to impress a buyer is to take a half-hour of his time when he's expecting you to take an hour. One of the worst is to take an hour and a half.

## 7 Silence

The meeting had gone exceedingly well. We were in London, and one  of  our  executives  had  just  made  an  excellent  presentation  to some British businessmen. I was sure these gentlemen were quite impressed.  A  kind  of  dramatic  silence  occurred  as  they  looked  at each other to see who was going to respond first.

But just as one of them was about to speak the executive began summarizing  the  positive  aspects  of  the  concepts  he  had  just presented. This happened a few times.

Finally, I actually laughed and said to him, 'Ah, the joys of silence … Let someone else speak.'

A lot has been written about the use of silence in selling. For good reason.  There  comes  a  point  in  almost  any  sales  pitch  where  the other  person should be talking, and there comes a point in almost any sales pitch where no one should be talking. It's pretty hard to get to either point if you don't know when to be silent.

Silence  has  so  many  different  selling  applications.  If  you  stop talking  and  start  listening,  you  might  actually  learn  something,  and even  if  you  don't  you'll  have  a  chance  to  collect  your  thoughts. Silence is what keeps you from saying more than you need to - and makes  the  other  person  want  to  say  more  than  he  means  to. Knowing when to remain silent can strongly influence the impression you  make  on  others.  And  furthermore,  it's  impossible  to  get  a commitment  out  of  someone,  if  that  person  can't  get  a  word  in edgeways.

The tactical  use  of  silence  serves  one  of  two  purposes.  It  either lets the other person talk, or forces the other person to talk.

I will often pretend not to know the specifics of a situation just to get the other guy talking.

Recently I was brought in at the tail end of a bitter renegotiation dispute. It had gotten pretty serious, and lawyers were sitting in on both sides.

Since I was the 'new kid on the block', I asked the other party to start  at  the  beginning  and  explain  to  me,  in  his  own  words,  his understanding of the dispute.

He  began  to  talk,  and  he  must  have  talked  without  pausing  for twenty minutes. (I could see his lawyer wince several times.) By the time  he  finished  he  had  come  around  -  or  talked  himself  into  agreeing with much of what our position was.

## Get Information By Not Asking For It

If  you  ask  a  question  on  a  particular  subject  and  the  answer  is unsatisfactory,  the  best  response  is  none  at  all.  If  you  are  seeking more  information,  or  a  different  kind  of  information,  ask  for  it  by remaining silent.

Silence is a void, and people feel an overwhelming need to fill it. If someone has finished speaking, and you don't play along by taking up  your  end  of  the  dialogue,  after  only  the  slightest  pause  that person will automatically start to elaborate. Eventually they may say what you want to hear.

## Bite Your Tongue

A learned - almost never instinctive - ability to bite your tongue has two incredibly important, often overlooked selling applications.

First, it allows you to collect your thoughts and therefore be more cautious  or  more  circumspect  in  what  you  say.  Second,  it  lessens your chance of saying a lot more than you need to, mean to or want to.

STATE THE POSITIVES, OMIT EXTRANEOUS NEGATIVES

I attended a meeting not too long ago with a business associate who was trying to involve a potential sponsor in a prestigious golf event, 'The Chevrolet World Championship of Women's Golf'. After stating all the positives of this involvement (and getting a good reaction), he switched enthusiastically to the television coverage. Even though, he said, this event was opposite the Men's PGA Championship, both his company and the network anticipated very good ratings.

Even  though  it  was  opposite  the  Men's  PGA  Championship? I couldn't believe my ears. Granted, in our role as consultants, this is precisely the kind of fact that we would point out to our clients. But as a salesman I think this is precisely the kind of fact that one omits.

The  important  facts  were  the  TV  coverage  and  the  anticipated good ratings, not a rundown of that day's TV competition. Even if my associate  felt  ethically  bound  to  bring  this  up,  his  timing  couldn't have been worse. He should have stated it at the beginning of the presentation,  before  all  the  positives,  rather  than  ending  it  on  a negative.

If  you're  selling  someone  a  transistor  clock/radio,  I  don't  think you're obliged to point out that the battery will run down in twentyone  months  or  that  a  year  from  now  there  will  be  a  better  digital model on the market for less money.

State the positives and omit irrelevant or semi-relevant negatives. Be ethical, be moral - and be aware of the joys of silence.

## The Pregnant Pause

The use of the  pregnant  pause  in  selling  is  very  much  like  fishing with a net. You put some bait in a net and silently wait for a fish to swim in.

Once you get to the point in a sales pitch where you have asked for  a  commitment,  don't speak  again until  the  other  person  has replied in some fashion. Don't restate your case. Don't lobby. Don't tell him you know it's a tough decision, but …

The buyer may be struggling with his decision and conducting an internal  dialogue  with  himself.  Don't  help  him  out.  If  he  asks  a question, answer monosyllabically.

Even if the silence is deafening, just let it sit there.

## Once You've Sold, Shut Up

I can't tell you how many times I've seen this happen: a sale is made and  the  salesman  immediately  raises  suspicion  by  heaping hyperbolic praise on the buyer's judgement: 'You won't regret this.' 'The best deal you've ever made.' Even the most trusting person will start to wonder, 'What have I just committed myself to?'

Once you've made the sale, anything else you say about it  can only work against you. So change the subject. Talk about the buyer's golf game, his kids - anything but how extraordinarily brilliant he is for buying your product.

Even worse than the flatterers are the salesmen who insist, right then and there, on crossing every 't' and dotting every 'i' - 'Great. Now let's go over these points again to make sure we are in total agreement.' At best, this approach dampens enthusiasm. At worst, whole deals can become unravelled.

## CONFIRM THE DEAL LATER IN WRITING

In truth, particularly if the deal is complex or negotiated over a long period of time, there probably will be some deal points or details on which the two parties are still hazy. Don't get into them now. Confirm your understanding later in writing. It allows the meeting to end on a positive up-beat note of good feelings, and it allows you to state in writing  your  version  of  these  sometimes  hazy  details.  Unless  they are major points, or terribly wrong, these will usually become basic tenets of the agreement.

## Marketability

Many  years  ago,  I  was  having  dinner  with  André  Heiniger,  the Chairman of Rolex, when a friend of his stopped by the table to say hello. 'How's the watch business?' the friend asked.

'I have no idea,' Heiniger replied.

His  friend  laughed.  Here  was  the  head  of  the  world's  most prestigious watchmaker saying that he didn't know what was going on in his own industry.

But  Heiniger  was  deadly  serious.  'Rolex  is  not  in  the  watch business,' he continued. 'We are in the luxury business.'

To  me,  Heiniger's  comment  summed  up  the  essence  of 'marketability'.  It  is  knowing  what  business  you  are really in  and understanding the underlying perceptions that connect your product to the people it is being marketed to.

Ever since the passing of the Model-T, the automotive industry has sold cars in terms of everything other than function - their power, sex appeal, luxury - where would we be without 'rich, Corinthian velour?' - economy, etc. Automobile advertising, in fact, has historically been so  persuasive  that  it  has  not  only  shaped  perceptions  but  created them. It was once true, for instance, that a college professor would rather  forfeit  tenure  than  be  spotted  driving  a  Cadillac.  If,  on  the other hand, a corporate executive chose to own a Volkswagen, one might seriously question if he indeed had the 'right stuff'.

Today's buyer, however, is more sophisticated than ever, and is so hyper-sensitive to being 'marketed to' that he may be turned off. This places  an  even  greater  premium  on  understanding  marketability, which to me is the more subtle, underlying aspect of marketing.

Federal  Express,  for  instance,  may  hard  sell  its  service emphasizing  speed,  dependability  and  size.  But,  as  may  be  fairly

obvious to anyone who has seen their commercials, what they are really selling is peace of mind.

One  of  the  most  subtle  forms  of  marketability  is  building  the perceptions  into  the  product  itself,  of  doing  everything  one  can  to make the product 'buyable'. This 'product', for instance - this book if  it  were  titled Principles  in  Practical  Management would  certainly appeal to a different audience, and probably, at least in terms of a potential, a much smaller one.

Marketability  cannot  be  'read  out'  from  market  studies,  market tests and focus groups but must be intuited. It involves looking at the fringes, and looking just beyond them, and interpreting perceiving -  underlying  motivation  and  why  someone  really  cares  or  doesn't about your product. Marketability is further distinctive from marketing in that it is done, or should be done, before the fact, and if it is done correctly it doesn't cost anything.

Marketability  is  also  the  more  active  form  of  selling.  Selling,  by necessity, is product-oriented - features, functions, advantages, etc. - but understanding your product's marketability puts the buyer into the picture - whether he or she is being sold to as the middleman (as in selling to a company) or directly as the consumer.

This chapter connects the two - product and people. It begins with product,  and  all  the  selling  truths  that  affect  it,  and  ends  with positioning,  or  how  what  you  say  or  show  about  a  product  can practically sell it for you.

## Know Your Product; Believe In Your Product; Sell With Enthusiasm

These  are  the  fundamental  selling  truths.  If  you  don't  know  your product, people will resent your efforts to sell it; if you don't believe in it, no amount of personality and technique will cover that fact; if you can't sell with enthusiasm, the lack of it will be infectious.

Nothing turns off a potential customer quicker than a salesman's lack  of  familiarity  with  his  product.  Have  you  ever  walked  into  a department store, asked a clerk how a particular gadget or appliance worked, then stood by while he fiddled with the knobs and wondered

out  loud  why  they  don't  make  things  simple  any  more?  Even  if  he finally gets it to work, by that time your interest has diminished and you are not likely to make the purchase.

Knowing your product also means understanding the idea behind it - its purpose, how it is perceived - the relationship between it and what  someone wants to  buy.  How  will  it  help  the  customer?  What problem is it solving? What is its promise?

An  understanding  of  these  intangible  features  is  at  least  as important as knowing a product's mechanical features. Yet precisely because  they  are  intangible,  and  may  vary  from  customer  to customer, they are more prone to misinterpretation, misunderstanding.

Knowing your product also means understanding the image it is projecting.  I  believe  all  products  project  an  image  of  some  sort.  It may be a positive  one,  which  you  want  to  promote,  or  a  negative one, which you need to overcome.

The  home  computer  industry,  for  instance,  really  didn't  take  off until  it  solved  its  image  problem.  Here  was  this  device  that  saved time and simplified all sorts of tasks, yet it looked complicated and difficult to use. Until it was made to seem 'friendlier', less forbidding, sales lagged.

## Two Reasons I Wouldn't Buy From Me

Part  of  knowing  your  product  is  knowing  all  the  reasons  someone might not want to buy it. Anticipate the reasons - state them clearly in  your  mind,  spell  them  out  on  paper  if  necessary  -  and  have  an answer ready for each of them.

A  good  portion  of  almost  any  sales  effort  is  spent  overcoming objections.  Don't  try  to  convince  a  buyer  that  his  objections  aren't valid. Concentrate instead on altering his frame of reference.

In  anticipating  and  overcoming  objections  a  salesman  has  to practise  a  kind  of  theory  of  relativity.  He  has  to  ask  himself 'Compared to what?' Think about a major purchase you have made - buying a house, for instance - and the mental gyrations you went through to get there. At some point you were making comparisons.

Compared to another house that interested you, but in a slightly less desirable  neighbourhood,  it  seemed  expensive.  Compared  to  what you could have bought it for ten years ago, it seemed outrageous. But compared to its resale value, compared to what someone else might have been ready to offer, compared to what you deserve, you were able to justify the price.

In licensing the name of an athlete, I know the two objections we are  most  likely  to  encounter  are  the  price  -  the  size  of  the guarantees - and the athlete's lack of availability to the licensors.

The president of a major apparel firm once told me that he wasn't going to pay an athlete more money than he was making himself. By this  criterion,  the  seven-figure  guarantee  that  we  were  asking probably did seem outrageous. But I was quick to point out that what he was buying was instant brand name identification and, compared to  the  tens  of  millions  of  dollars  it  would  cost  to  develop  a comparable  degree  of  brand  recognition,  the  guarantees  were indeed reasonable.

He also questioned why, if he agreed to pay that kind of money, he was only entitled to five days of the athlete's time. Again, it was a matter  of  altering  his  frame  of  reference.  From  which  would  his company  benefit  more,  I  asked:  from  additional  department-store promotions or from this particular athlete winning more major tennis competitions? And didn't he agree that the best use of the athlete's time, as far as his company was concerned, would be hitting millions of tennis balls on his way to Centre Court at Wimbledon?

By helping the buyer see a different frame of reference, by altering his  perceptions,  we  were  able  to  finalize  a  licensee  deal  that  has resulted  in  the  company's  most  successful  line  of  apparel  and  in several million dollars of income to our client.

## Beating Dead Horsemeat

A  dog-food  company  was  holding  its  annual  sales  convention. During  the  course  of  the  convention  the  president  of  the  company listened  patiently  as  his  advertising  director  presented  a  hot  new campaign, his marketing director introduced a point-of-sale scheme

that would 'revolutionize the industry', and his sales director extolled the virtues of 'the best damn sales force in the business'. Finally, it came time for the president to take the podium and make his closing remarks.

'Over  the  past  few  days,'  he  began,  'we've  heard  from  all  our division heads and of their wonderful plans for the coming year. Now, as we draw to a close, I have only one question. If we have the best advertising, the best marketing, the best sales force, how come we sell less goddamn dog food than anyone in the business?'

Absolute  silence  filled  the  convention  hall.  Finally,  after  what seemed like for ever, a small voice answered from the back of the room: 'Because the dogs hate it.'

Sometimes  an  idea,  a  product,  a  concept  is  just  plain  bad.  No matter how you flog it, no matter how you restate it, it simply won't work. The only solution is to walk away, to cut your losses.

Yet  a  lot  of  people  try  just  the  opposite.  The  more  the  evidence mounts  that  an  idea  may  not  be  saleable,  a  concept  may  not  be workable,  a  product  not  desirable,  the  more  determined  they become, the more time they spend, trying to prove otherwise.

## The 80/20 Rule

Since I have devoted the first third of this book to the importance of knowing your customer, it should be apparent how I feel about this.

The sales efforts of most people and companies follow the 80/20 rule - 80% of your business is done with 20% of your customers. It makes  sense  to  focus  four-fifths  of  your  time  and  effort  getting  to know the one-fifth of your customers who are the most important to you.

Many years ago we were hired by Wilkinson Sword in England to do a sports and leisure-time profile of all their key customers. Once the survey was completed we customized a series of sports outings, personalized to the customers' recreational tastes. The boxing fans and their Wilkinson counterparts were taken to a night at the fights with Henry Cooper, the European heavyweight champion at the time, acting  as  their  host;  the  golfers  played  golf  with  Tony  Jacklin;  the

cricket fans attended a pre-test match breakfast with the Australian cricket champion, Ian Chappell.

Focus on the interests, predilections and tastes of your top 20% and take the time to figure out what you can do to keep them there.

## Know The Company

There are two key points to knowing your customer's company. First, it  can  tell  you  something about the best overall approach. Second, though  the  person  you  are  selling  to  may  have  total  authority  and autonomy, you are ultimately selling through him as the company's representative to the company itself.

Companies  can,  and  should,  be  'read'  just  as  people  can.  The methodology,  in  fact  -  forming  gut  impressions  based  on  raw perceptions - is almost the same. Watch the way a company does business,  how  fast  it  has  grown,  and  the  way  it  has  chosen  to position  itself  in  the  marketplace.  Size  and  longevity  alone  can  be indicators.  Obviously  one  does  not  sell  to  IBM  the  same  way  that one would sell to an Apple, or to an AT&T the way one would sell to an ICI. The approach, ranging from a mature, conservative one to a more  aggressive,  let-it-all-hang-out  technique,  should  parallel  the image of the company itself.

But keep in mind that the momentum of a company is so slow and ponderous that even if their stated goal is to change their image and direction they will still buy according to the old one. I recently had a series  of  meetings  with  Procter  and  Gamble  who,  fearing  they  are losing touch with the times, are desperately trying to modernize their consumer  approach.  It  became  apparent  to  me,  however,  that,  as much as they would like to, they are still bound to their old ways of looking at things, and it will take them at least a while to alter this course.

We  recently  approached  Tiffany's  regarding  our  desire  to represent the licensing of their name. Two separate but related facts helped us bracket our approach.

First, Tiffany's had recently been bought by Avon, a publicly held, bottom-line company, which implied to me they would be more open

to  commercialization than they had been as a privately held, élitist one.  Secondly,  Tiffany's  was  still  Tiffany's,  and  part  of  its attractiveness  to  Avon  as  an  acquisition  certainly  had  to  be  in  the implicit  quality  of  the  name.  If  'licensing'  conjured  up  images  of Smurfs or Cabbage Patch Dolls, we wouldn't get to first base. Our best approach was similar to the one we had taken with Wimbledon, which  was  to  stress  visibility  and  quality  -  how  licensing,  if undertaken with selectivity, discrimination and taste, would serve to enhance the up-market value of the Tiffany name.

## GETTING TO THE RIGHT GUY

One of the biggest problems we have had as a sales organization is figuring out who within another company will be making a decision on  what.  Very  often  in  our  business  we  don't  know  if  it's  the advertising  department,  the  marketing  department,  or  someone  in PR or corporate communications. It may very well turn out to be the chairman and CEO of a multi-billion dollar corporation if the subject is of personal interest to him.

In certain companies, particularly in multi-national, multisegmented  operations,  it  is  almost  impossible  to  figure  out  the decision-making  process,  or  to  find  any  sort  of  central  authority. Decisions  seem  to  be  made  by  some  mysterious  consensus  that even  the  highest  echelons  of  management  can't  explain.  This,  of course, is a problem in dealing with companies of this sort, and very often the only solution is not to deal with them at all.

In most companies, however, the decision-making process is not only  there  somewhere,  it  is  discernible  -  as  are  the  names  of  the decision  makers.  To  find  them,  it  is  mostly  a  matter  of  doing  your homework and asking the right questions.

## IF YOU DON'T KNOW, ASK

Most sales are not cold calls. There is some contact or connection which gets you thinking about a particular company in the first place.

Most people are only too happy to tell you everything you need to know about the company they work for, such as how it is structured and who reports to whom. Without much coaxing (and by knowing when to remain silent) you can learn almost anything else you want

to  know  -  the  company's  priorities,  its  problems,  its  strengths  and weaknesses, internal squabbles, power struggles, etc. This kind of information  is  useful  because  a  company's  real  decision-making process is rarely the way it looks on a flow-chart.

Of course, you have to consider the source of the information, and filter  it  through  your  reading  of  that  person.  People  will  often  imply that  you  should  be  dealing  with  them,  but  you  can  tell  by  the  way they talk about someone else - in a jealous manner or in a way that contradicts  what  you  already  know  -  that  the  person  they  are describing is actually the person you need to see.

Another  excellent  source  of  information  is  anyone  who  has successfully dealt with that company before, and therefore has some insight  into  its  bureaucratic  secrets.  This  can  be  their  advertising agency, a friendly competitor, or even someone else within your own company.

## DON'T BE MISLED BY TITLES

Assume almost nothing from titles. I used to think, for example, that the  head  of  General  Motors  International  would  be  an  important decision maker in terms of GM's overseas operations. I soon found out that he had literally no decision-making authority, except in the broadest sense, and that GM companies throughout the world were almost totally autonomous.

The  reasons  why  someone  is  called  vice-president  are  as numerous as the vice-presidents. Even in companies where titles are justly awarded, there is always a lag time: people about to move up, people  about  to  move  down  and  people  about  to  move  out.  An assistant  marketing  manager  may  be  the  real  marketing  decisionmaker.  There  are  also  pet  projects  and  oddball  areas  of  authority that don't conform to any job description.

When  David  Foster,  a  golf  lover,  was  Chairman  of  Colgate,  we knew  that  he  would  make  every  decision  relating  to  their  golf sponsorship, even down to where to place the latrines on the course. On the other hand, when I flew to Japan to discuss sponsorship of the  women's  pro  tennis  tour  with  Toyota,  I  discovered  my  meeting was  with  an  'assistant  manager'  in  the  PR  department.  I  began explaining how the sponsorship worked - this much for this, another

half  million  for  the  bonus  pool,  and  so  on  -  and  the  assistant manager  kept  nodding  his  head  in  agreement.  I  was  sure  I  was talking  to  the  wrong  person,  and  that  this  one  didn't  understand  a word I was saying. We later got a signed contract for over $5 million.

## FIND A STAR

And make him a friend. People both inside and outside our company are always telling me how 'lucky' I am to have personal relationships with the CEOs of so many companies around the world. In the vast majority  of  these  cases  I  had  met  these  people,  spotted  their  star quality, and made a concerted effort to get to know them many years before  they  became  their  company's  CEO,  and  in  several  cases before they had even entered the ranks of upper management.

One of  the  most  important  things  anyone  can  do  in  business  is consider  his  or  her  future  connections.  Your  contemporaries  today will  be  running  companies  tomorrow.  Find  the  stars  in  other companies and make them friends. Ten years from now - whether you're selling to them, buying from them, hiring them, or being hired by  them  -  they  will  become  one  of  your  most  important  business assets.

## THE MULTI-NATIONAL RULE

Remember,  no  top  executive  is  ever  happy  with  his  company's international operations. Do something for his company internationally and it will open the door for domestic opportunities as well.

## Positioning

The  word  'positioning'  in  business  has  scores  of  meanings.  A company positions itself for the future; a product is positioned for the market-place; you position yourself for advancement or for a sale.

The word has so many business meanings, in fact, it can become meaningless.  I  am,  therefore,  defining  it  here  very  narrowly  as  it relates to your product or service.

In this sense, positioning is a matter of determining what someone is really buying  when  they  buy  your  product  or  service,  and  then conveying those impressions and motivations to the buyer.

This  often  requires  converting  human  emotions  into  product characteristics:  'Be  a  winner  by  going  with  a  winner.'  It  demands intelligence,  know-how  and  forethought,  and  at  its  highest  level becomes an art form with a tangible pay-off: your product or service is practically pre-sold.

## POSITIONING 1: IS IT A FORD OR A MERCEDES?

Positioning is first and foremost a numbers game, going from mass a Ford or Sears (affordability) - at one end of the market spectrum to élite - a Mercedes or Rolls-Royce (quality, luxury) - at the other.

While  élitism  can  be  a  potent  buyer  motivation,  it  can  also  be dangerous.  Companies  go  just  as  broke  positioning  themselves above their market as below it.

A company must figure out where it fits on this spectrum - where the biggest bulge of its buyers is.

We recently finalized a fascinating licensing/endorsement/spokesperson  deal  for  Arnold  Palmer  with Sears (similar in concept to Sears's arrangement with Cheryl Tiegs). It was fascinating to me because of its irony.

For  two  decades,  we  had  consciously  positioned  Arnold  at  the upper end of the market spectrum - affiliating him with such brands and companies as Rolex, Cadillac, Robert Bruce and Hertz. Sears, meanwhile,  had  recently  concluded  that  rising  buyer  sophistication had pushed them down a couple of notches from where they wanted to be. When Sears decided to upgrade its image, Arnold, like Cheryl, was  an  ideal  choice.  Had  it  not  been  for  Arnold's  previous  'up market' affiliations, he would not have been so perfect.

## POSITIONING 2: WEIGHING THE FACTS

A  good  salesman  can  take  ten  facts  about  a  product,  and  by stressing  some  and  de-emphasizing  others,  create  ten  different impressions. That's what salesmanship really is: positioning the facts to get the desired response.

The  incredible  success  in  Japan  of  the  American  golfer  Laura Baugh was a direct result of how we chose to position the facts.

Laura was an All-American type - cute, blonde, vivacious - who had shown great promise as a Californian amateur. But at seventeen years old she had yet to prove herself on the pro tour.

We knew the Japanese liked All-American types almost as much as  they  liked  golf.  But  since  Laura  could  not  be  marketed  as  a champion,  we  chose  to  play  down  her  golfing  prowess  altogether. Instead, we positioned her as a kind of American beauty queen who happened to play a great game of golf.

The results were extraordinary -posters, calendars, endorsements,  an  endless  stream  of  licensing  opportunities.  She became the hottest attraction in Japan, even hosting her own primetime television show. By the time she returned to the United States to join the pro tour, her positioning was already well established.

Laura has yet to win a professional golf tournament, but she has probably earned more money off the course than any player in the history of women's golf.

Another example is model Jean Shrimpton, who in the late 1960s and early 1970s was known as 'the most famous face in the world'.

When  Jean  retired  from  modelling  she  moved  to  Cornwall  in England, and embraced the role of wife and mother.

The striking  contrast  in  lifestyles  -  from  glamour,  flashbulbs  and Vogue covers  to  English  country  gentlewoman  -  provided  an interesting  positioning  opportunity,  that  of  a  world-famous  model giving up all the glamour for the simpler pleasures of family life. Now Jean  has  the  opportunity  to  work  just  a  few  days  a  year  for handsome fees doing 'family-style'  commercials  for  margarine  and other household products.

## POSITIONING 3: DOING IT WITH MIRRORS

This  is  the  most  sophisticated  type  of  positioning,  and  it  can  go wrong as often as it goes right. It doesn't mean belying or ignoring the facts, but reflecting them in such a way that it creates the desired perception. It is done by beginning with the perception and working backwards.

The  best  example  I  can  give  of  this  is  'The  Killy  Challenge',  a television  show  we  created  for  NBC  in  the  wake  of  Jean-Claude Killy's three Olympic gold medals.

It was important to Killy's ongoing merchandising credibility that he continue  to  be  perceived  as  a  'winner'  -  as  the  best  in  the  world. 'The Killy Challenge' was a series of mano-a-mano downhill races in which  world-class  skiers  would  challenge  Killy's  supremacy.  But since  Killy  was  'the  best',  the  challenger  would  always  be  given  a handicap  -  a  head  start  -  and  in  skiing  a  handicap  of  several seconds can mean several hundred feet.

Visually, the drama was never a matter of Killy winning or losing but  whether  or  not  he  would  catch  up  after  spotting  another  skier several  hundred  feet  below.  It  was  Killy,  'the  best  in  the  world', against himself, with  the  other  skier  serving  as  a  measuring  stick. The desired impression was achieved even before he left the starting gate.

## POSITIONING 4: IMAGING

Another  type  of  positioning  involves transcending the  facts  associating  your  product  or  service  with  positive,  desirable  values which have little or nothing to do with the product itself.

This  is  an  approach  often  taken  by  the  blue  chip  companies: Coca-Cola has positioned itself right up there with Mom and apple pie; AT&T and GE stress family values and 'homey' feelings; the oil companies  have  become  'environmentalists';  and  IBM  and  Xerox promote their standard of excellence, positioning themselves above their competitors.

We do this on a lesser scale with our sports clients. Athletes don't go on winning for ever, and we've always felt it was important to 'get them off the playing field' as quickly as we could.

This  doesn't  mean  forced  retirement.  It  does  mean  positioning them  in  such  a  way  that  their  fame  is  no  longer  dependent  on winning  championships  or  dominating  the  sport  that  made  them famous in the first place.

For our golf and tennis clients, we usually avoid what we call the 'win ads' - television or print advertising geared to the client's status as  a  current  champion  of  a  major  tournament.  After  all,  what

happens when he or she is no longer the 'current' champion? Calling Björn Borg the 'five-time Wimbledon champion' totally overshadows the fact that he is no longer even playing at Wimbledon.

Jackie Stewart is another example: he has not raced competitively in a decade, yet his image as an automotive expert, a 'connoisseur of aerodynamics' transcends his sport, his need to win - or even to race.

## How To Determine Value

A lot of the time you can't. But the usual business answers - 'what someone is willing to pay' or 'what it costs us to make' - are often worse  than  no  answer  at  all.  Consumer  product  businesses  are particularly guilty of this: pricing becomes a function of manufacturing costs.

In determining the value of what you're selling, it's helpful to ask yourself some of these questions:

How unique is it? Can they buy it for less from my competitor?

If so, are there some real qualitative advantages to my product?

Can I sell it for more to their competition?

How badly or how quickly do they need it?

What would it cost to replace it?

Are there any precedents that can help me?

Is there a 'passion factor'? Suppose you got a craving to buy an ice cream cone, and when you get to the shop you discover the price has doubled. Are you still going to buy it?

Is this a one-time deal, or is this the future?

When  you  have  a  pretty  good  idea  of  value,  don't  be  afraid  to name your price. In fact, this is the negotiating instance where it may be  to  your  advantage  to  go  first.  Have  your  'back  up'  at  your fingertips.

When value is guesswork, try to protect yourself in other ways in the event of success:

The Norfolk and Western Railroad had been trying to get the Fuji Iron  &  Steel  Company's  rail  business  in  the  United  States.  They learned that Fuji's president was a golf fanatic, and a Jack Nicklaus fan in particular, and so they approached us about arranging a golf date  between  Fuji's  president  and  Jack  in  Japan.  We  charged $10,000  (this  was  the  mid-1960s!)  plus  expenses  (we  had  to  get Jack to Japan anyway), and felt pretty good about the deal.

Five  years  later  I  ran  into  the  vice-president  of  Norfolk  and Western. He brought up the Nicklaus/Fuji golf outing and said, 'You know, we've done about seventeen million dollars' worth of shipping with Fuji since then.'

We  couldn't  have  known  that,  but  neither  could  Norfolk  and Western. Since, I've often asked myself why I hadn't added, '… plus one per cent of any business this generates'. I think they would have said 'fine'.

## 9 Stratagems

## Placing

People  often  underestimate  the  importance  of  a  conducive  sales atmosphere.  Just  as  there  is  a  right  time  to  make  a  sale  there  is usually  a  right  place  for  it  as  well.  The  worst  place  may  be  the buyer's office. It can't compare to over lunch, after a tennis game, on a golf course, or anywhere where his receptivity is likely to be up and his guard is likely to be down.

I  know  of  a  producer  who  received  a  commitment  for  sixty-five hours  of  family  television  programming  on  the  basis  of  a  half-hour pilot.  He  screened  the  pilot  on  a  Saturday  at  the  television executive's  home,  in  his  den,  on  his  giant  TV  screen,  with  the executive's wife and two kids, while they all ate popcorn. What could the executive say: 'I don't like it. Give me back my popcorn and get out of my house'?

One of our most effective services is directed towards helping our corporate clients 'place' their sales effort. We arrange, for instance, annual  ski  outings  for Time magazine  and  annual  golf  outings  for Newsweek for  the  purpose  of  entertaining  the  CEOs  of  their  key advertisers. The settings are invariably spectacular, and if you are a skier or golfer where would you rather talk business - in your office, or at a ski lodge in Sun Valley or at the clubhouse at St Andrews? (It also gives these magazines a direct link to the top if anything goes wrong at the ad level.)

A chance encounter at a non-business location can also present an  opportunity.  Have  you  ever  unexpectedly  run  into  a  strictly business associate at a beach or tennis club? Some awkwardness usually  accompanies  the  experience  because  both  parties  want  to

avoid 'talking business' like the plague. Bring it up anyway. Not only will  it  diffuse  the  awkwardness,  it  can  set  certain  wheels  in  motion that can be followed up back at the office.

## The Pre-Conditions Of A Sale

Over  a  period  of  several  years,  we  had  tried  to  sell  Ford  and  its Lincoln Mercury Division all sorts of projects that our company was involved in. I literally deluged Ben Bidwell, then General Manager of Lincoln Mercury, with proposal after proposal. One day, probably out of  a  sense  of  frustration,  he  called  me  and  said,  'Mark,  you  really have no idea how to sell the Ford Motor Company, and if you would bring a couple of your people up here and let us explain to you why, it would save us both a lot of time in the future.'

I took two of our executives up to Dearborn, Michigan where over the  course  of  several  hours  we  received  a  thorough  indoctrination into what Ford was looking for, how we should present it, and whom we should be presenting it to.

That  meeting  led  to  the  creation  of  the  World  Invitational  Tennis Classic, which was enthusiastically sponsored by Ford and televised over the ABC Network for the next several years.

But, even more important, I came away with an understanding of the two pre-conditions of almost any successful sales effort:

- 1. Find out what they want to buy. If you don't know, ask, and let them tell you. Find out a company's problems, then show them how 'we can work together' to solve them. It is so much easier to sell someone what they want to buy than it is to convince them to buy what you are selling.
- 2. Find out who does the buying. Every company has its system, procedures and pecking order for making decisions. Don't always buck it.

People have a need to say no. So let them.

If  you  have  a  shopping list,  throw  in  a  few  ringers.  Collect  some negative currency before you get to whatever it is you really want to sell.

If  you're  only  there  to  sell  one  thing,  make  a  suggestion  or assumption and let them tell you you're wrong. People also have a need to feel smarter than you are.

A few well-placed 'no's create the right environment for a 'yes'.

The Hertzes, the Avises, the Cokes and Pepsis are not the only companies  in  the  world  looking  over  their  shoulder  and  reacting strongly  to  their  competition.  I  would  say  that  99.999%  of  the companies do.

So, find out whom your would-be clients hate. That knowledge can help you push them towards your deal, particularly if they are sitting on the fence ready to teeter off to one side or the other.

## Expose Rather Than Sell

Many times our best sales approach has been merely to expose a product to a prospective buyer and let the exposure speak for itself. The  buyer's  mind  runs  rampant  with  possibilities,  and,  in  his  own words, he begins to tell you - and to convince himself in the process - what it is that he wants to buy.

This  technique  has  been  particularly  effective  for  us  in  selling commercial tie-ins to special events such as the Nobel Prize Awards and the Wimbledon Championships. Merely exposing a customer to the tradition and prestige of these events - as guests of the King and Queen of Sweden or of the All-England Club - is the only selling that is  really  needed.  They  soak  up  the  atmosphere  and  become enveloped in it, and from that moment on they want to be part of the experience, will begin to develop their own promotional 'fits', and will start to sell us.

If you have confidence in your product and know the customer will ultimately be satisfied, an equally effective variation is to expose him to it by giving it away. In our effort to convince companies to make promotional  use  of  our  golfers  or  tennis  players  we  have  often

provided  the  client  at  no  compensation,  knowing  that  the  client's personality and personability would help us do the convincing.

I  am  also  a  great  believer  in  offering  a  product  or  service  and telling the customer that we can establish the price later on, that he can establish it for us, based on what he felt it was worth. Again, you have  to  know  your  customer.  There  are  people  we  deal  with  who would just as soon add another zero and there are those who are more likely to subtract one.

## Get Them A Little Bit Pregnant

When a company expresses genuine interest in your idea, product or concept, start to get them a little bit pregnant.

Collect - aggressively solicit - their opinions on the deal and allow these to shape your idea or presentation: 'We were wondering suchand-such'; 'Would it be better to emphasize this or that?'; 'We'd like to know your feelings on the following …,' etc.

It  is  better  to  solicit  this  kind  of  information  in  a  letter,  which requires more thought to answer. It is also better to avoid questions that can be answered 'yes' or 'no' for the same reason.

There is nothing easier than selling someone his or her 'own' idea, which is what this becomes.

If you can get enough answers on the details, people will commit themselves to the larger deal long before they are actually aware of it.

Similarly,  you  should  determine  mutually  agreeable  objectives beforehand which can be precisely defined and clearly stated. Any proposal, concept or idea which directly responds to those objectives is half-way to being sold.

## Use 'Them'

The head of our television department approached me recently and asked me to attend a meeting. He anticipated closing a sale, but it was  a  complicated  situation  involving  several  parties.  Everyone

wanted to do the deal, but it had yet to be determined precisely how these parties would interact - i.e., who would be doing what for how much. He felt my presence would be helpful to 'our side'.

I felt the opposite and chose not to attend. My reasoning was very similar to my feelings about handling a crisis: the best first reaction is no reaction at all. My presence would have meant that I would have to react. I wanted to keep our options open until we had a chance to analyse  the  results  of  this  meeting.  I  preferred  that  this  executive have to check back with 'them' (meaning in this case, 'me') before making any final commitments.

People use the absent, undefined 'them' all the time in selling, but I  think  it  is  usually  done  as  a  matter  of  practicality  rather  than calculation.  In  most  cases  people  really  do  have  to  check  with someone  else;  and  'they'  or  'them'  is  at  least  useful  in  the  cases where they don't.

Outside our company, most people I deal with assume that I am the  final  decision-making  authority,  but  I  will  rarely  commit  myself until  I  have  'consulted'  with  the  appropriate  executive  or  division head.

The converse of this can also work to your advantage. In any new business situation, when someone tells me 'I'm the decision maker around here', and I have reason to believe this is true, my lips start to smack. He has already cut off his first line of defence.

## Show Up

I first met the gentleman who heads our apparel division over twenty years ago. He was president of a major clothing manufacturing firm at the time, and he had called me in Cleveland to express an interest in affiliating Gary Player with one of his apparel lines. We decided we should meet and we did - at his office in New York at 9 a.m. the next morning.

Years  later,  he  told  me  that  when  I  offered  him  a  job  with  our company this was one of the main reasons he had taken it. He had been so impressed by my hopping on a plane and showing up the

next  morning  he  thought  we  would  be  an  interesting  company  to work for.

Today,  my  itinerary  is  so  tight  (and  sometimes  planned  out  six months in advance) that I can't do this as much as I'd like to. But one of  the  best  sales  techniques  that  I  know  of  is  to  ask  when  can  we meet  and  how  soon  -  and  then  show  up.  Usually  the  farther  you have to fly, the more impressive it is.

## Divide And Conquer

This  is  probably  more  appropriately  called  'Unite  and  Conquer', though the people you are 'uniting' may not always agree.

Suggest the same idea to two different key executives in the same company. If  you  can  get  them  to  agree  separately  that  the  idea  is sound, then, when you put them together, a sale is probably going to be the result.

What  you  are  doing,  in  essence,  is  acting  as  their  middleman. ('Bob, Bill  really  likes  this';  'Bill,  Bob  really  likes  this.')  Each  will  be reassured by the other's desire to do the deal; each will be able to take credit  for  the  concept;  and  each  will  feel  less  at  risk.  You  will also be hastening the process of commitment by forcing a decision without seeming to do so.

We had a version of this used effectively on us, which we began referring to internally as 'the Fila trick'.

Fila  is  the  Italian  sportswear  company  which  manufactures  and licenses  Björn  Borg's  tenniswear.  In  the  early  days  of  Fila's development,  their  people  would  ask  the  same  question  -  usually concerning  what  Borg  would  or  would  not  do  in  terms  of  time commitments - of five or six people within our company. Since they were  dealing  with  us  in  so  many  parts  of  the  world,  they  became very proficient at this tactic. They would use what they were told in Australia to their best advantage in Japan; they would use what they were  told  in  Japan  to  their  best  advantage  in  England,  and  so  on until they circled the globe - combining the best of each answer into one unbelievably favourable response.

## Sell One-To-One

I hate sales presentations made to a large group of people and will avoid these situations whenever I can. To me, a large group is more than one.

Find the key guy and sell one-to-one. If you try to sell to more than one person at the same time, you are introducing into the sale the dynamics  of their inter-relationships,  which  can  do  nothing  but detract from your purpose. You can't know who is there to impress whom, who is only interested in looking good, or in making someone else look bad. You may suspect, but unless you are working within their company you can't know.

Sell  directly  to  the  key  person,  and  if  he  likes  what  you're proposing he will know best how to sell it in.

## The Chinese Menu Syndrome

There is usually more than one way to solve a marketing problem, and  it  is  the  seller's  responsibility  to  find  the  best  way  and  to emphasize that while de-emphasizing the others. Don't get caught in the choose-one-from-column-A-two-from-column-B trap.

If  you  give  the  buyer  a  choice,  you  are  introducing  a  whole  new layer  into  the  decision-making  process.  Not  only  are  you  asking  a customer to make a commitment, you are also asking him, 'Which one do you want to commit to?'

We  have  had  situations  where  we  proposed  more  than  one solution to a potential customer's problem. Frequently, the result is that he will like something about each solution. That sounds terrific, but it isn't. By offering a choice you often help the customer focus as well on what he doesn't like about each solution.

## Remind Them Of Your Glorious Past

I  bring  up  Arnold  Palmer's  name  in  business  conversations  all  the time,  including  those  which  have  nothing  to  do  with  Arnold  and,

indeed,  nothing  to  do  with  golf.  It  is  simply  that  Arnold's  financial success,  and  the  role  we  played  in  it,  are  two  of  the  things  our company  is  best  known  for.  As  an  individual,  my  relationship  with Arnold is more often recognized than I am: 'Oh yeah. The gay who manages Arnold Palmer.'

People in business want to do business with winners. It helps to make  your  present  customers  aware  of  either  your  own  or  your company's big wins in the past. Out-and-out bragging is not a very good idea, but it can be done subtly in a million other ways.

Bring  in  your  credits  and  achievements,  or  your  other  blue  chip clients,  not  as  direct  statements,  but  as  examples  of  the  kinds  of things you have done for others that you would like to do for them now.

## Correspondence Tools

The format of  standard  business  correspondence,  when  used  with care and discretion, can be an interesting sales tool.

## OPEN COPIES TO A MAN'S BOSS

This virtually assures you of a response, and probably a quicker one than you would get otherwise. Even if you don't know the superior, it will give the impression that you do.

Letters can also be written in such a way - though this technique is usually more advisable over the telephone - as to imply that the superior would really like to see the deal go through.

The pitfalls to open-copying a man's boss are obvious, particularly if you  know  the  recipient  will  be  the  ultimate  decision  maker. Generally, I use this as a last resort - once more traditional efforts have been exhausted and I am reasonably sure that the recipient, left to his own devices, will continue to ignore letters and phone calls.

## BLIND COPIES TO A MAN'S BOSS

A blind copy to the recipient's immediate superior can be even more effective. Of course, in this case you'd better know the superior and

know  that  he  will  discuss  the  contents  of  your  letter  with  the recipient.

This is most useful in those situations where your initial contact or discussions  were  with  the  superior,  and  the  subject  of  them  has since  been  delegated  to  the  recipient.  It  is  therefore  perfectly legitimate to copy the recipient's boss. Since it is a blind copy, the recipient, from that day forward, will never know who else you might be copying, and is more likely to consider carefully the contents of your letter.

## 'DICTATED BUT NOT READ'

The legitimate use of this term, of course, is when you are unable to review a dictated letter once it has been typed. But it is also useful for  sending  up  a  trial  balloon  or  phrasing  something  in  a  more aggressive way than you would have had you had the 'opportunity' to soften it.

If  the recipient finds it offensive or over-reacts to it, you have still made your point but can retract the way in which it was made.

## Not-Invented-Here

The not-invented-here complex, or the trashing of an idea or concept by  someone  because  he  or  she  didn't  originate  it,  is  one  of  the biggest sales problems we have had to face in every division of our organization.

We are often contacted directly by companies inquiring about the services  of  one  of  our  athletes  or  the  implementation  of  a  sports promotion.  Once  we  have  developed  a  programme  that  everyone seems  to  like,  the  company  feels  compelled  to  run  it  by  its advertising  agency.  The  agency,  because  it  did  not  originate  the idea, feels equally compelled to punch holes in it.

I used to believe that the not-invented-here complex was unique to the  nature  of  our  business.  But  I  have  talked  to  enough  people  in enough different businesses now to understand that not only is the problem pervasive, it may be endemic. There's a tendency, maybe even a need, to knock any idea that isn't your own.

The  conventional  wisdom  in  dealing  with  this  problem  is  'make them think it's their idea'. This is perfectly good advice in selling, but totally impractical and useless in dealing with not-invented-here. Any effort along these lines is going to seem transparent and patronizing.

The practical solution is to make them see their self-interest.

It  is  perfectly  apparent  to  me,  for  instance,  that  if  a  proposal reaches the state of ad agency review it means that someone (and more  likely  several  someones)  within  the  agency's  client  company already likes it. But I've seen paranoia become so rampant that the ad  agency  will  start  to  tear  apart  the  idea  even  before  asking politically sensitive questions, such as who within the client company likes what and why.

Obviously, if this is apparent to me, it is my job to make it equally apparent to the person doing the reviewing - to show him where his self-interest probably lies.

Recently,  I  met  the  chairman  of  a  Fortune  500  company  under quasi-business circumstances and during the course of a conversation with him mentioned a concept we were developing that I felt might be appropriate for his company. I could see his eyes light up, but he said that anything of this sort would have to originate with his  promotion  department  and  gave  me  the  name  of  a  particular person I should contact.

When I  followed  up  several  weeks  later,  the  idea  was  met  with overwhelming disinterest. I then related precisely the circumstances under which I had met the boss and the reaction I felt I had observed and suggested that it was in the promotion director's best interest to learn more about what we had in mind.

Ultimately, everybody won. We sold them the idea, it worked, and though  the  idea  didn't  originate  with  this  particular  person  he received sole credit within his company for its success.

## Visual Aids

Rock Resorts, the Rockefeller family-owned chain of luxury resorts, were  in  the  process  of  constructing  one  of  the  most  glamorous resorts in Hawaii, called the Mauna Kea, and Laurence Rockefeller

and his staff had flown out from New York for a full day of meetings. Crucial  decisions  had  to  be  made  involving  millions  of  dollars  in expenditures and commitments.

Apparently, fairly early on in these meetings someone brought out colour swatches of the various motifs that were being considered for the  table  linen  in  the  dining  room.  People  in  the  room  became  so interested in the colour swatches - each throwing in his decorating opinion - that when it came time for Rockefeller to fly back to New York most of the major issues were still unresolved.

I've never seen a bad idea sold because of great visual aids, and I've never seen a good idea go unsold because of lack of visual aids. Moreover, if  not  properly  used  and  appropriately  timed,  visual  aids (anything  from  charts  and  graphs  to  elaborate  multi-media  shows) can work against you.

First, people have opinions on everything. If you're not careful, you can find the conversation deflected towards a critique of your visual aids  rather  than  holding  to  what  you  are  there  to  sell  in  the  first place.

Second,  if  introduced  too  early  in  the  presentation  it  can  be distracting. All of a sudden everyone's playing with your visual aids while your sales strategy and game plan go out the window.

Until you are ready to get to the 'show' part of the show and tell, keep your visual aids out of sight. You don't want people waiting and wondering what you've got in that little black box.

## 10

## Negotiating

I  have  heard  or  read  on  more  than  several  occasions  that  I  am  a 'tough' or a 'hard-nosed' negotiator. It's probably not a bad reputation to have precede me - people expect me to ask big numbers - but I prefer to think of myself as an effective negotiator, rather than as a tough one.

I actually take more pride in my sales ability than in my negotiating skills, because it is much harder to make someone want to buy than it is to define the terms under which they are buying.

In fact, I often see negotiation as the last step in an ongoing sales effort,  the  culmination  of  a  process  that  may  have  lasted  several months or more.

When the time comes to negotiate, certain principles do apply.

## What, When, Where, How Exclusive And How Much?

All five of the questions asked above should be answered during the course of negotiation. Each can be expanded, limited or traded off as the negotiation dictates.

Even  in  cases  such  as  real  estate  where  all  five  would  not generally apply, it is still a useful list to run through. It might provide solutions ('Rather than buy this property from you, suppose I were to lease it for ninety-nine years') which weren't contemplated when the negotiation began.

## THE WHAT

What is it, precisely, that you are selling? With celebrities it always comes down to two things: their name and their time. But this still

leaves  the  'what'  question  far  from  answered.  What  rights  are  you selling to the name and time and for what use is it intended?

## THE WHEN

This means how long, from 'one contiguous eight-hour period' which can be used to define a work day, to 'for ever'.

## THE WHERE

'Territory', which can range from 'the world' to 'South Cincinnati', is an  interesting  area  for  trade-offs  and  multi-national  multi-regional contracts. We have several television properties, for instance, which are licensed in more than a hundred territories, some of which are defined  by  national  borders,  others  by  a  common  language.  It  is because of the territorial  aspect  of  negotiation  that  we  maintain  so many offices  around  the  world  -  and  thereby  stay  so  many  jumps ahead of our competitors.

## THE HOW EXCLUSIVE

We  have  found  this  to  be  an  attractive  negotiating  chip.  To  what degree does the buyer wish (and are we willing) to shut out the rest of the competition? This can mean product exclusivity, industry-wide exclusivity, territorial exclusivity, a 'head start' exclusivity - all sorts of interesting things when linked to other aspects of the negotiation.

## THE HOW MUCH

This  means  money,  but  not  necessarily  money  alone.  It  can  also mean  stocks,  securities  or  other  forms  of  equity.  For  us,  it  often means  'how  much  time'.  Time  is  an  active  professional  athlete's most cherished commodity. He or she must spend a certain amount of  time  practising  or  playing  in  tournaments  or  games.  Since  time can't  be  manufactured  or  expanded,  we  guard  with  a  bulldog's tenacity the number of 'personal days' an athlete must commit to a client.

## Don't Get Hung Up On How Much

This  always  reminds  me  of  the  'baseball  bat  method'  of  choosing sides:  about  half-way  up  the  handle  you  suddenly  know  how  it's going to come out.

When one party starts out at twenty and the other party starts at ten  and  you  end  up  with  fifteen,  that's  not  a  negotiation;  that's splitting  the  difference.  Moreover,  you  run  the  risk  of  neither  party being  'happy'  with  fifteen  and  both  feeling  they  are  'losing'  if  they accept anything less.

Don't deal with numbers in isolation. Negotiation is more intricate and subtle than that. Numbers are just one piece - no bigger and no smaller than the other pieces - of the negotiating pie.

## BIG COMPANIES DON'T MEAN BIG BUCKS

The bigger the company the more money they have to spend.

In theory this is true; in practice it is quite the opposite. The bigger the  company,  the  more  compartmentalized  they  are,  which  means the more budgets that need to be tapped in order to come up with the necessary financing.

I've seen multi-million dollar commitments made by one person in a  medium-size  company,  and  I've  seen  one  of  the  biggest companies in America require six different decisions by six different divisions to approve a $50,000 expenditure.

## LET THE OTHER GUY GO FIRST

Very often, it's a good idea to let the other party take first crack at the terms  and  numbers.  At  the  very  least  it  tells  you  something  about what he's thinking. And there have been many occasions when the other  party's  first  offer  was  higher  than  the  opening  or  even  the closing figure I had in mind.

Sometimes you can pull out the numbers from the other party by asking  a  series  of  hypothetical  questions  based  primarily  on  the other  terms:  'If  you  were  to  do  this  and  we  were  to  do  that,  how much could that be worth?' 'Suppose we were to throw in this and add that?' 'Suppose you were to put a dollar figure on it …?'

PLAY IN THE MAJORS

When  confronted  with  naming  your  terms  or  price,  counter  by recalling a similar deal which establishes your 'ball park', albeit the best possible ball park you wish to be in: 'When we recently sold 'X' to company 'Y', we received '$Z'.'

There is no implicit challenge in this approach. It gets your point across  without  moving  the  other  party  into  a  defensive  position  … and it gets him thinking at higher levels.

## DON'T DEAL IN ROUND NUMBERS

Round numbers beg to be negotiated, usually by counter-offer round numbers. Odd numbers sound harder, more firm, less negotiable.

I hate to hear 'a hundred thousand dollars' as a number thrown out in  negotiations. That's the world's most negotiable number. Make it $95,500  or  $104,500.  Either  way  you're  probably  going  to  end  up with more.

## Deal In Psychological Currencies

Over the years we have made great use of psychological negotiating chips - deal points which seem innocent enough on the surface but carry with them potent underlying psychological impact. They make excellent  negotiating  currency  because  their  power  is  rarely understood by the other party. I can recall countless occasions when we  have  used  this  to  break  deadlocks  -  to  give  the  other  parties exactly what they wanted while keeping them totally unaware of how much more we were getting in return.

One  of  my  earliest  examples  of  this  occurred  during  our negotiation with Slazenger/Australia over the length of Gary Player's equipment  contract.  Slazenger  wanted  a  short-term  contract:  one year with renewable options. We were loath to give it, because if for some  reason  it  did  not  work  out  Gary  would  then  be  'damaged goods' as far as his equipment affiliation in Australia was concerned. But Slazenger would not budge an inch - or, in this case, a day which  is  when  we  came  up  with  what  we  later  began  to  refer  to internally  as  our  'Australian  termination  clause':  the  contract  was

made terminable by either party from the moment it was signed - but on five years' notice.

My  theory  was  that  Slazenger  would  be  reluctant  to  terminate anyone  whom  they  would  still  be  affiliated  with  personally  and committed  to  financially  for  another  five  years,  and  would  work harder to see that this never happened.

Gary's contract with Slazenger is presently in its twentieth year.

In the late 1960s we reached a similar impasse with All State Life Insurance  and  Arnold  Palmer,  again  involving  the  length  of  the contract.  We  wanted  a  fifteen-year  contract,  and  while  Judson Branch, CEO of All State at the time, did not object, he was planning to retire soon and did not want to burden his successor with a longterm  contract.  He  was  therefore  insisting  on  a  three-year  contract with options to renew.

This  concerned me even more than it normally would because I knew who the new CEO was going to be, knew that his ego could not  stand  sharing  the  spotlight  with  Arnold,  and  knew  he  would probably never extend or renew the contract if he could get out of it cleanly.

What  we  ultimately  agreed  upon  was  a  fifteen-year  contract terminable after three years with the payment of a penalty fee. The key  was  to  make  the  penalty  fee  slightly  larger  than  the  annual retainer fee.

I had two theories on this one. First, it is one thing not to renew a contract, and psychologically quite another to have to go to Arnold and say, 'We want to terminate you.' Second, even if All State did decide  to  terminate,  I  felt  I  could  convince  them  to  extend  for  an additional year (and then another and then another) as long as the termination penalty was larger than the annual retainer.

The contract continued for many years even under the new CEO.

## Avoid Showdowns

Somehow,  negotiating  has  become  confused  with  machismo,  as though the whole point is to outlast your opponent, to make him back down first.

The point of negotiation is to reach an agreement that is mutually advantageous to both parties. To make it a contest of egos can only work against  you.  Don't  use  phrases  like  'deal  breaker',  'take  it  or leave it', or 'that's non-negotiable' - anything that makes you sound like you're daring the other person to knock a chip off your shoulder.

Don't  raise  controversial  issues  which  have  only  an  indirect  or insignificant  relationship  to  the  deal  being  discussed  or  to  the ongoing relationship.

These issues, too, are often the result of ego or a kind of bravado: 'Then  you  can't  do  this'  or  'Then  we're  going  to  exclude  that.'  In many  cases  these  issues  have  a  way  of  turning  into  deal  points which you would otherwise win by fiat.

## Negotiate Backwards

I find it helpful to try to figure out in advance where the other person would like to end up - at what point he will do the deal and still feel like he's coming away with something.

This is different from 'How far will he go?' A lot of times you can push someone to the wall, and you'll still reach an agreement, but his resentment will come back to haunt you in a million ways.

The best way to find out the 'magic point' of a negotiation is to ask - if somewhat indirectly.

We try to get a sales estimate: 'By affiliating so-and-so with your product, how many units do you anticipate selling?'

Usually they'll inflate the figure a little bit to impress you with their expertise. But we can use that figure to determine a dollar guarantee that they can live with, and we can back it up with their logic.

## Trade Places

Another  way  to  find  the  magic  point  is  to  put  yourself  in  the  other guy's shoes. Run through a scries of questions and answer them as though you were he : 'What are 'my' real limitations?' 'How badly do 'I'  want  this  deal  to  happen?'  'What  are  'my'  options  if  it  falls

through?' 'Will 'I' look good, or will 'I' have to always be defending this  internally?'  'And  what  trade-offs  can  'I'  get  to  assure  that  this doesn't happen?'

This can often help you envisage where you are going to end up with amazing clarity.

## Mollify Then Modify: The Use Of 'But' And 'However'

Acknowledge  the  other  party's  feelings.  This  is  the  oldest psychological  technique  in  the  world,  and  works  just  as  well  in negotiations  as  it  does  in  any  other  form  of  human  relations.  It sounds  as  though  you  have  accepted  or  committed  to  something, when in truth all you have 'accepted' is how the other party feels.

The  conjunctive  clause,  which  allows  you  to  cancel  out  the  first part  of  a  sentence,  is  a  wonderful  negotiating  tool:  'Yes,  but  …';  'I know how you feel,  but  …';  'I  know  exactly  what  you  mean  and  I couldn't agree with you more, but …'.

People who have mastered this technique can get blood out of a stone.  They  have  a  way  of  turning  almost  any  negotiation  into  a penitent/confessor relationship.

## Deflect With A Question

If you don't like what you're hearing respond with a question, even if it's no more than, 'Why are you saying that?' It may cause the other side  to  scrutinize  their  position  a  little  more  closely.  It  softens  your response.  At  the  very  least  it  keeps  them  talking  while  you  keep listening.

## Question Positions But Don't Ignore Them

I  have  been  in  many  negotiations  where  I  have  said  something  or responded in some way, and the other person has continued talking

as  though  I  had  never  opened  my  mouth.  There  is  nothing  more frustrating in any sort of business communication, or more disruptive to negotiation, than to get the feeling you are talking to someone with a hearing defect.

Playing  dumb  is  a  valid  negotiating  technique,  and  'I  don't understand'  is  a  legitimate  negotiating  response.  But  to  ignore  the other party's position or to pretend you didn't even hear it because you didn't want to hear it will only build up frustrations. Moreover, the more the other party is forced to repeat his or her position, the more that position is going to harden.

## Sweeten His Self-Interest

Another  negotiating  technique  that  I  have  found  effective  is  to sweeten  the  deal  with  things  that  aren't  that  important  to  me  but could be important to him. This can include terms which have little or nothing to do with the deal at hand.

We have, for instance,  agreed  to  provide  particularly  hard-to-get seats to the Olympics in a contract that otherwise has nothing to do with  the  Olympics.  On  another  occasion  a  social  golf  outing  was arranged between one of our golf clients and the boss of the person we were negotiating with.

Never overlook the barter possibilities of throwing in quantities of your  product,  which  you  get  at  cost,  but  which  are  valued  by  the other party at something closer to retail.

The  absolute  masters  of  this  technique  are  members  of  both houses  of  Congress,  who,  as  a  matter  of  course,  coat-tail  the interests  of  their  constituents  -  and  thereby  their  own  -  on  to  bills that  have  absolutely  nothing  to  do  with  their  local  dam  projects  or fish hatcheries.

## Keep Your Time Frame To Yourself

The pressure to get a deal done can make you say and do things that  aren't  in  your  best  interest.  Whether  your  deadline  is  real  and

absolute (it rarely is), or merely desirable or convenient, don't let the other  party  know  about  it.  If  the  other  party  knows  you  have  a deadline, they really don't need to know - or give on - anything else.

Conversely,  their  deadline  is  one  of  the  most  valuable  pieces  of information you can extract from them.

Time itself - or the passing of it - can also be one of your most valuable  negotiating  allies.  Anxiety,  and  the  desire  to  get  a  deal done, breeds hyperkinetic behaviour. There is a natural tendency to speed up the negotiation process rather than to slow it down. Force yourself to resist this urge and take advantage of it in others.

In any negotiation which is drawing to a close, but in which issues remain to be resolved, I have conditioned myself over the years to request automatically that it be carried over to the next day. This, at the very least, gives me time to clear my head, and often results in the other party making major concessions, just so he doesn't have to spend another night thinking about it.

It is also worth remembering that agreement isn't needed on every point in order to reach a deal. We have a significant percentage of contracts  in  our  files  which  stipulate  that  certain  points  will  be resolved in the future so as to let the basic agreement proceed.

## Using Emotion

Negotiations  are  seldom  formal  sit-around-the-table  affairs.  In  fact, almost  any  form  of  business  problem  or  disagreement  -  from  a threatened  union  walk-out  to  'Who's  going  to  pay  this  $500 expense?' - is resolved by some form of negotiation. The less formal these negotiations are, the more likely emotion is going to play some part.  Whoever  controls  the  emotional  content  of  these  disputes  is almost always going to walk away with the bigger winning.

## PERCEIVE ANY BUSINESS DISPUTE AS THE BEGINNING OF A NEGOTIATION

Simply by perceiving it  this  way,  you  will  become  more  calculating and less likely to respond in your own worst interest. Psychologically, your focus will be more on getting what you want and less on getting something off your chest.

## STEP BACK AND RELAX

Counter emotional outbursts by going emotionally limp. Say anything except what you probably want to say. 'Let me think about that' or 'I'll call  you  back.'  Perceive  it  as  a  game  with  winners  and  losers because that's what it is: a game of wits - and who's going to be the first to lose theirs.

## SEE EMOTIONAL OUTBURSTS AS OPPORTUNITIES

This  is  negotiation  through  counterpunching.  Once  the  other  party has  thrown  the  first  emotional  blow,  he  has  given  up  a  certain amount of control. Depending on how you respond, you can accept that control, or give it right back to him.

## ACT IN ANGER, BUT NEVER REACT IN ANGER

Anger, and other strong emotions, can be effective negotiating tools, but only as a calculated act, never as a reaction. I read somewhere that a photo of Nikita Khrushchev's historic shoe-pounding incident at the UN revealed that he was still wearing both his shoes. A third 'for-pounding-only' shoe? That's calculation.

## GET THEM CHARGED UP ABOUT SIDE ISSUES

Effective  negotiating  demands  an  absolute  clarity  of  purpose,  an ability  to  keep  mentally  focused  on  the  ends  while  all  the  while discussing the means. If you suspect someone is not a very good negotiator - even though he prides himself on being one - he will almost always be satisfied with a few side victories if you make them seem to be more than that. Get him charged up about side issues, make 'reluctant' concessions, and then walk home with the big prize.

## Use Candour

Candour, when properly used, is one of the most powerful, effective -  and  underused  -  negotiating  techniques  I  know  of.  When negotiations become excessively tense, are about to get out of hand, or are in danger of falling through, a moment of candour - 'Look, I really want this to go through' or 'This is very important to me' - not

only  brings  back  perspective,  it  will  often  totally  disarm  the  other party.

An  impasse  which  moments  earlier  seemed  insurmountable  will start  to  disintegrate.  And  a  conciliation,  which  moments  before seemed unthinkable, will seem possible after all.

## Are You Negotiating From Strength Or Weakness?

This  is  an  important  question  to  ask  yourself  before  actual negotiations  begin,  and  can  usually  be  answered  from  the  selling effort  alone.  How  hard  can  you  push?  How  badly  does  the  other party  want  this  deal?  How  does  the  other  party  perceive  your position?

There is a vast difference, of course, between legitimate positions of  strength  and  weakness,  and  the perception of  those  positions. The  game  aspect  of  negotiation  is  saying  and  doing  things  which puncture  those  perceptions  that  come  too  close  to  reality,  while encouraging  those  perceptions  which  are  farthest  from  the  truth. Internally, we call this 'swooping and darting', or not letting the other party get a fix on our position.

If you are negotiating from strength, the more you let your strength be known, the more the other party will go out of his way to disabuse you  of  it.  Even  the  most  obvious  compromises  will  become concession  stand-offs,  with  the  other  party  insisting  on  winning  all the minor points because he knows he will have to fold on the big ones.

The  other  danger  of  negotiating  from  strength  is  that  there  is  a tendency just to get the deal done rather than to get the best deal. Strength in a negotiation seems to quell one's desire to hang tough to fight for all the minor points because the bigger ones have already been conceded. Yet it is these fringe areas that make the difference between a good agreement and a so-so one.

The final point in negotiating is to get as much as you can but to get  something. Over  the  years  I  have  run  into  many  people  who consider themselves excellent, tough negotiators - and yet for every

deal  they  rammed  down  someone's  throat  there  were  two  that  fell through.

Once two parties have acknowledged in some way that they can both benefit from agreement - which is usually the stage at which a negotiation begins -it is inexcusable, barring unforeseen circumstances, not to reach one.

## Contracts

One party generally benefits more than the other from vague or nonbinding  language  in  a  contract  or  letter  agreement.  Determine  up front whether a vague agreement or an air-tight one better suits your purpose.

I  prefer letter agreements to more formally constructed contracts. Blue-bound documents tend to scare people. A well-drafted contract is  one  that  is  air-tight,  contains  almost  no  legal  phraseology,  and reads like a letter from home.

Always draft first. Once you begin the process of converting deal points  into  language,  scores  of  questions  come  up.  You  want  the opportunity to get your version down on paper first.

There  is  one  exception  to  this.  If  you  are  in  unfamiliar  legal territory,  it  is  often  quite  revealing  to  see  what  the  other  party considers important by what they have included in the contract.

When  re-draft  language  comes  back,  treat  it  in  a  covering  or amendment letter rather than drafting again from scratch and forcing the entire contract to be re-reviewed (it is impossible for a lawyer to go  through  a  contract  a  second  time  without  coming  up  with additional points).

The  'definitions'  section  of  a  contract  should  be  carefully scrutinized  if  you  are  on  the  reviewing  end  and  scoured  for opportunity if you are doing the drafting. What something is legally called can alter everything else in the contract.

Many years ago, when we were negotiating Gary Player's golf club contract with Shakespeare Golf, we wished to have the right to do a separate deal for golf grips. Golf grips are sold to golfers who want their  clubs  re-gripped  because  they  are  old  or  have  lost  their  feel,

and  while  this  was  totally  non-competitive  with  the  Shakespeare agreement we knew if we raised this issue they would resist. And so in the 'definitions' section of the contract we narrowly defined a 'golf iron'  as  a  'metal  flange  attached  to  a  metal  or  fibreglass  shaft  by means of a hozzle'. We made no mention of grips, ultimately did a separate  deal  with  a  grip  company,  and  the  Shakespeare/Player agreement continued amicably for many years.

Legal  phraseology  should  be  considered  red  flags.  Lawyers  can draw from a litany of words, terms and phrases which are intended to reverse the meaning of everything that comes before or after.

Break  down  guarantees  and  royalties  into  their  lowest  common denominator. If the contract includes more than one product or more than  one  territory,  divide  the  guarantees,  get  them  allocated accordingly, and make each a separate account. (There have been many  occasions  -  separately  accounting  Australia  and  England comes immediately to mind - where this has resulted in hundreds of thousands of dollars more in royalty income.)

Speed of execution is critical. Enthusiasm for a deal diminishes as time goes by.

Don't  send  contracts  directly  to  legal  departments,  but  to  the people  with  whom  you  are  dealing.  They  are  likely  to  be  just  as impatient with their own legal department as you are. Internally, they will often take your best position against their own legal department ('that's  a  meaningless point')  just  to  get  it  out  of  the  department  in question.

## Part Three Running a Business

## Building a Business

Today,  the  International  Management  Group  is  a  management, consulting and marketing firm operating out of fifteen offices around the world. The activities of its twelve companies range from creating and implementing sports events for over one hundred corporations to  operating  fashion  modelling  agencies  out  of  New  York  and London. This year, gross revenues will exceed $200 million, which makes us a small to medium-sized company in the general scheme of things, but something of a force in the business of sports: we are involved in over forty of them.

I did not envisage what has come to pass when I first shook hands with Arnold Palmer back in 1960. At the time, I was a young lawyer simply looking for a way to combine one of my lifelong passions golf - with my day-to-day business activities. (This still may be one of the better ways to start a business: what are you really passionate about in life and is there any way to make a living at it?)

As an amateur golfer, I was good enough to qualify for the 1958 US Open, but smart enough to know I would never make it big on the pro tour. For me, the next best thing was representing those who did.

In assessing the decisions we made that helped us grow, I realize that  there  is  nothing  we  have  done  that  was  all  that  unique  or unconventional.  The  success  we  have  had  -  and  I'm  immodest enough to think we've had quite a bit - is confirmation that the things that are supposed to work really do work and the things that aren't supposed to don't.

A  lot  of  building  a  business  is  listening  to  your  own  common sense,  then  taking  the  necessary  steps  to  turn  the  theories  into practice.

## Commit (Early On) To Quality

When  I  first  started  representing  Arnold  he  had  won  one  major championship  in  1958  which  was  followed  by  a  lack-lustre  year  in 1959. Our second client, Gary Player, was barely known at all in the United  States  when  we  signed  him,  though  in  the  1958  US  Open Gary  finished  second  to  Tommy  Bolt  and  impressed  me  with  his courage and his determination to play well in strange surroundings under  extreme  pressure.  When  we  began  representing  our  third client, Jack Nicklaus, he was still an amateur.

Arnold, Jack and Gary are three totally different personality types, but all three possessed the quality - class - that would make them champions off the golf course as well as on it. They were not just quality golfers; they were quality people.

I  was  simply  trying  to  sign  up  the  best  golfers  I  could  who  also seemed to have the kind of character a company would want to be associated with. I didn't realize until later - fortunately, not much later - that I was, in fact, making a 'commitment to quality'.

I  can't  think  of  any  business  where  such  a  commitment  doesn't apply. Start with the best, or what you think is going to be the best. It will get you started on the right foot; it's the only absolute competitive edge; and it's like working with a net: a hedge that will minimize bad decisions and maximize good ones in the future.

## Be Smart Enough To Know When You're Lucky

As it  turned  out,  Palmer,  Player  and  Nicklaus  were  not  just  quality golfers.  They  would  totally  dominate  the  world  of  golf  for  two decades.  By  1969  they  had  won  twenty  of  golf  's  major championships,  and  the  list  of  Masters  Champions  from  1960  to 1966  read  like  this:  Palmer;  Player;  Palmer;  Nicklaus;  Palmer; Nicklaus; and Nicklaus.

They  became  known  as  the  'Big  Three'  of  golf,  and  if  they  had been three of our first twenty clients, or even three of our first ten, my whole philosophy about business might have been different. But with

250 golfers out on the tour, we had gone three-for-three. It was like winning a lottery.

Lady Luck had been kind to us, as I think she often is to a lot of businesses. And while I'm sure we had helped make our luck, this initial success had been far too phenomenal simply to take it in our stride,  congratulate  ourselves  on  how  smart  we  were,  and  wait  for lightning to strike again.

I  think  that  was  one  of  the  most  important  decisions  we  ever made. We were going to accept our good fortune for what it was, but we weren't going to sit around until another 'Big Three' came along.

## Grow Slowly

Of the twenty-odd years we have been in business, the first six - or nearly  a  third  of  our  life  span  -  were  limited  to  representing professional golfers. I felt we had too much to learn to do anything else. I also wanted to get better before we got bigger.

So  many  companies,  particularly  in  this  high  tech  age,  are unwilling  to  do  this.  They  would  rather  grow  quickly  than  profit quickly. If these companies would slow down a little, take some time to  analyse  their  success,  and  allow  their  depth  of  management  to catch  up,  I  think  they  would  see  that  they  could  have  both  -  a healthy growth rate and healthy profitability.

It's a simple business truth that you can't stay the same size. But we resisted, and continue to resist, the pressure to grow too fast.

By  1966  we  had  become  a  major  presence  in  golf.  We  were organized, we had the right people in place, and we knew where we were going. I thought we had better diversify.

## Diversify Your Expertise

If we have had a formula for growth it has been: start with the best; learn  from  the  best;  expand  slowly  and  solidify  our  position;  then horizontally diversify our expertise.

By the mid-1960s we had thought about expanding for some time, and the most obvious choices - tennis was still an amateur sport were  any  of  the  three  major  team  sports  -  football,  baseball  and basketball. But we had learned a couple of things which made this less obvious.

First, we were not agents as much as managers. Agents are guys who book bands and negotiate player contracts with team owners. There were no team owners in golf.

Our interest and expertise had always been in developing income opportunities  for  our  clients  off  the  playing  field,  in  establishing licensing  and  promotional  relationships,  and  managing  them  in  a way  that  would  provide  those  athletes  with  a  steady  income  long after their playing days were over. I also felt the regionality of most team  sports  athletes  would  severely  restrict  their  marketability. Golfers, on the other hand, were almost as saleable in Tokyo or in Kalamazoo as they were in their home towns.

Second, I was pretty well convinced that the 'weekend warrior', the guy who played golf once or twice a week and watched sports on television, could more readily identify with Arnold Palmer, hitching up his pants on the 18th tee, and then splitting the fairway with a 300yard drive, than with anonymous people in pads and helmets.

Our goal, therefore, was to branch out into other individual sports, preferably  those  with  an  international  profile,  and  sign  individual stars  who  would  benefit  from  our  total  management  approach  to representation.  We  signed  Jackie  Stewart  who  was  the  world's leading race driver in 1966, and soon added a score of other worldclass  drivers,  including  Peter  Revson,  Mark  Donohue,  François Cervert  and  Graham  Hill.  (At  the  time,  we  failed  to  recognize  the major  difference  between  golfers  and  auto  racers:  golf  doesn't  kill you. The emotional price was high.)

In 1968, when tennis abandoned its amateur status, we were able to sign Rod Laver and Margaret Court, then the world's leading male and female players.

1968  also  produced  another  opportunity  -  the  Olympics,  and skiing's first international superstar, Jean-Claude Killy.

Each of these sports has since produced a stable of clients which has given us prominence - and dominance - in these areas.

We began diversifying our expertise in other ways. Representing golf 's élite had given us the opportunity to learn quite a bit about a number of other businesses. We took advantage of this knowledge and established a separate golf equipment company for Arnold and two internal apparel divisions, one of which was later sold to NBC. In the late 1960s we also signed our first two non-sports clients, Hank Ketcham, the creator of 'Dennis the Menace', and Jean Shrimpton, the world-famous model.

## Hire The Best To Teach You What You Don't Know

When  you're  building  a  company,  you  sometimes  hit  gaps  in knowledge which you know you'll have to fill if you want to continue to grow. We weren't ignorant of television, but we felt our experience was limited enough to be dangerous.

In the 1960s an unholy alliance was developing. Sport was helping to make television, and television was helping to make sport. Each was using the other to its own advantage, and so successfully it was impossible (and still is) to predict where it would all end.

About  this  time,  a  vice-president  at  the  Music  Corporation  of America by the name of Jay Michaels approached me on behalf of MCA's  Chairman,  Lew  Wasserman.  Michaels  was  something  of  a legend  in  the  television  business.  He  had  engineered  the  network deal for the fledgling American Football League, which gave the AFL its foothold and ultimately led to its merger with the NFL. Probably no one knew more about the incestuous relationship between sport and television.

Michaels  told  me  that  Wasserman  was  thinking  about  starting  a leisure  sports  division  and  wanted  to  know  if  I  was  interested  in running it for them.

After some soul-searching, and some discussions with several of our key executives and some of our top clients, I declined. I felt our independence was too important, and, since we were still growing, I thought  we  might  be  stifled  by  being  part  of  a  larger,  more established company.

But not too long after this I approached Jay Michaels. I told him of our desire to become more involved in the television business. I told him what I felt  the  potential  was,  the  degree  of  commitment  I  was willing  to  make  in  order  to  realize  that  potential  -  and  I  told  him  I wanted his help.

I happened to hit him with the right situation at the right time and in 1967  he  came  to  work  for  us  as  the  head  of  our  newly  formed television division, Trans World International.

Today TWI is the world's leading independent producer of sports programming  and  the  world's  largest  representative  of  television rights  to  international  sporting  events.  We  produce  or  co-produce nearly  200  hours  of  sports  programming  each  year,  including  'The Superstars'  and  'Battle  of  the  Network  Stars'  for  ABC,  numerous skiing,  track  and  field  events  for  CBS,  'The  World  Professional Figure Skating Championships' and 'The Chevrolet World Championship of Women's Golf' for NBC. We represent international television rights for, among others, Wimbledon, the US Tennis Open, the NFL, the National Basketball Association and most of the major golf championships.

TWI has also produced dozens of documentaries for such events as Wimbledon, the British Open, the US Open, etc. It also represents a  number  of  sportscasters  including  John  Madden,  Jimmy  'the Greek'  Snyder,  Chris  Shienkel,  and  Al  Michaels  …  Jay  Michaels's son.

With Jay Michaels's help we had bridged the gap.

Today  I  believe  in  the  importance  of  training  more  than  the importance of hiring, which, after twenty years, may be an indication of our company's maturity.

## Look To World Markets

We  learned  very  early  that  anything  America  had  the  rest  of  the world  was  going  to  want.  If  signing  up  the  'Big  Three'  was  the luckiest  thing  we  ever  did,  then  setting  up  a  bona  fide  network  of international offices was the brightest. This was done in anticipation of  the  world  demand  for  world-class  athletes,  but  subsequent

developments, such as satellite television,  have  made  it  look  even smarter.

Today, each of our fifteen full-time offices around the world is run and almost fully staffed by the nationalities of the countries in which they are located. We also share offices with local business partners in a dozen other countries.

Because of the flexibility and opportunities that these offices have given us, I am constantly amazed by the lack of attention and low priority most  American  companies  give  to  their  international divisions.  If  American  companies  spent  as  much  time  and  effort selling  their  products  overseas as they do in trying to keep foreign producers out, I think we'd see the flow of currency change direction overnight.

## Charge For Your Expertise

Many companies fail to place a premium on the real dollar worth of their expertise, or what it would cost an outsider to learn what they already know. So did we for about ten years.

During that time, we had been involved with more than a thousand companies in one sports promotion or another. We had amassed an enormous body of knowledge as to how companies should go about realizing  their  marketing  goals  through  sports.  And  we  often  gave away this knowledge. If a company signed on John Newcombe, and then didn't know how to use him, for everyone's sake we had to step in and show them.

By the early 1970s we recognized that more and more companies wanted  to  get  into  sports  but  had  no  idea  how  to  do  it.  Their advertising  agencies  were  not  capable  of  intelligent  advice  in  this area; their public relations firms didn't have a clue; and if they did get in  it  was  usually  because  some  high-ranking  executive  had  a particular  interest  in  a  particular  sport  (usually  the worst reason  to get involved).

We finally began charging for our expertise. Today, our corporate consulting  division,  Merchandising  Consultants  International  (MCI), is  our  fastest  growing company, as it had been throughout most of

the 1970s. MCI goes into a company and works with its marketing group to develop sports promotions that are not only cost-effective but  have  some meaning in  terms  of  the  company's  specific objectives.

The demand has been even greater than we had anticipated. MCI lists  more  than  one  hundred  corporations  on  its  client  roster, including many leaders of their respective industries, such as Sears, Kodak,  R.  J.  Reynolds,  AT&T,  Seagram,  Rolex,  Hertz,  Heinz,  the Hearst Corporation and Procter and Gamble.

MCI's  success,  and  the  pedigree  of  its  clients,  suggested  to  us that  there  might  be  other  ways  to  profit  from  our  specialized expertise.  This  led  us  into  the  business  of  creating  sports  events, and implementing them at an add-on cost or in exchange for a profit participation.  These  events  are  often  televised,  and  when  they  are we charge for this expertise as well.

This  concept  has  led  to  the  creation  of  the  'Legends'  men  and women's tennis tours, the World Championship of Women's Golf, the Pepsi  Grand  Slam,  the  World  Triathlon  Championship  and  literally dozens of other tours and events.

If  companies  took  the  time  to  realize  the  true  worth  of  their expertise,  they  could  use  it  for  growth  opportunities  which  might otherwise  be  overlooked:  as  a  separate  profit  centre,  such  as  we made of our consulting division; as an add-on to goods or services; as a sales incentive.

Even  if  you  must  give  away  your  expertise  as  a  price  of  doing business, it's  helpful  to  know  what  it's  really  costing  you  -  and  it's helpful to let the buyer know as well.

Companies are often shy about doing this. It always reminds me of the story about the woman who approached Picasso in a restaurant, asked him to scribble something on a napkin, and said she would be happy to pay whatever he felt it was worth. Picasso complied and then said, 'That will be $10,000.'

'But you did that in thirty seconds,' the astonished woman replied.

'No,' Picasso said. 'It has taken me forty years to do that.'

## Diversify Talent

Many companies - Procter and Gamble comes immediately to mind -  will,  as  a  matter  of  policy,  shift  their  personnel  from  division  to division.  The  idea  behind  this  is  that  these  employees  will  be motivated  by  new  challenges,  and  the  divisions  will  benefit  from  a transfusion of new blood.

I  think this policy fails on both counts. The employee either finds he is doing pretty much the same thing, only somewhere else in the chain of command, or something totally different, in which case his previous  expertise  is  rendered  useless.  Meanwhile,  his  former division finds it is always training people who will soon be gone.

We do it differently.  When we take a new diversification step, or start  a  new  business,  we  draw  from  our  existing  talent  pool.  Very often the employees tapped for these new responsibilities continue with some of their old ones as well. Once they have become familiar with the new demands on their time, they hire the necessary support personnel  or  draw  in  additional  talent  from  other  divisions  to  deal with appropriate aspects of both their old and new responsibilities.

Our financial management division, for instance, has been called by Money magazine  'arguably  the  best  financial  planners  in America'. Recently we began offering this service to corporations. As an added perk a company can pay us to do the personal financial management for its top executives.

Our people offering this service are the same people who manage Arnold  Palmer's  tax  shelters,  Björn  Borg's  real  estate,  Jackie Stewart's  investments,  and  Alberto  Salazar's  and  Sebastian  Coe's trust  funds  (Salazar  and  Coe  are  still  amateurs  and  their  income goes  into  a  trust).  The  point  is  they  will  continue  in  this  capacity, even with their formidable new responsibilities.

Apart  from  in  our  consulting  division  (which  must  remain autonomous), I don't think we have one key employee who has only one job. Some of our key executives draw their pay cheques from as many as six different divisions. It wreaks havoc on the flow-charts, but it cuts down on job boredom, not to mention overheads. (I live in terror of Parkinson's law.) Employee motivation is one of the classic corporate problems I've never had to contend with. Everyone is too busy.

## Take A Second Look At Timing

Timing, as we've seen, is critical to selling. For us, it has been even more significant as it relates to corporate growth.

When we began representing Jean Shrimpton in the late 1960s, I looked around and decided this was not a business we wanted to be in.  Back  then  a  good  hard-working  model  could  earn  $30,000$40,000 a year, with Shrimpton being perhaps the only exception.

Today  models  make  $200,000-$300,000  a  year  and  there  are perhaps  a  dozen  making  much  more.  With  licensing  opportunities being what they are today, the superstars are earning - or should be earning - seven-figure incomes.

Modelling is  a  profession  in  which  salaries  have,  one  might  say, exceeded inflation. And so we decided it was time to take a second look.  Now that we have our marketing and licensing expertise, our many corporate affiliations, and our offices in all of the world's major fashion  capitals,  what  hadn't  made  much  sense  originally  made  a whole lot of sense. Today we own Laraine Ashton, London's leading model  agency,  and  Legends,  the  fastest  growing  agency  in  New York.

The same thing happened with team sports. We had dabbled in this  area  throughout  the  1970s  (the  first  million  dollar  contract, Czonka/Kiick  to  the  World  Football  League,  was  ours)  but  we  had never made it a corporate priority.

Today a utility infielder or a place kicker can make several hundred thousand dollars. Moreover, judging from the success we've had in selling world television rights to NFL games, I predict we are not too far away from the day when income opportunities for football players will be available in Tokyo.

Two years ago we took a second look and began to strengthen our team sports division. By the end of 1985 we will be a major factor in this  business, and within the next five years the dominant factor in the business.

## Short Term Can Be Terminal

Over  the  years,  we  have  been  fortunate  enough  and  successful enough to contend with an interesting corporate problem: how to be profitable without being a profit-monger.

Personally,  in  any  new  business  we  have  gone  into  I  become unhappy  with  anything  less  than  a  100%  market  share.  But, corporately, I'm smart enough to know that short-term greed is one of the biggest mistakes a company can make.

We have often been accused of trying to 'take over' a sport, most notably  golf  and  then  skiing  and  then  tennis  and  now  running.  It hasn't  happened,  and  we've  been  involved  with  golf  for  almost  a quarter of a century.

In  a  sport  such  as  tennis,  where  we  represent  many  of  its corporate sponsors, all merchandising and TV rights to Wimbledon, the television rights  to  the  US  Open,  fifteen  of  the  top  twenty  men and women players, and run numerous events and series of events, I  have no doubt, if we wanted to, we could make an impact on the way the sport is structured and the way it is governed.

That  would  be  very  short-sighted.  Our  long-term  interest  is  in enhancing any sport in which we are involved, doing everything we can  to  help  it  grow.  This  is  not  because  we  are  'good  sports',  but because  we  are  good  businessmen.  Obviously,  the  growth  of  our business is linked, has always been linked, and will continue to be linked  to  the  growth  of  sports.  Right  now  I  don't  see  that  growth ending  anytime  soon,  and  any  short-term  gains  we  might  make  at the expense of the sport would be like killing our own golden goose.

Closely allied to this is another criticism we hear all the time, which is  that  we  are  guilty  of  conflict  of  interest.  How  can  we  fairly implement an event in which we represent the sponsors, the players, the television rights and the governing body? The answer is … very carefully.

When the potential for a conflict of interest does indeed exist, we lay all our cards on the table. In fact, this sort of full disclosure is our protection. In every instance I can recall, we have demanded as a condition of our involvement that every party know what every other party was doing, that every party know where we were involved and how  we  were  involved,  and  that  every  party  understand  that  all

disputes  would  be  resolved  frontally  and  with  the  full  participation and knowledge of everyone.

Ironically,  we  have  lost  several  clients  because  they  have  'heard about'  IMG's  conflict  of  interest,  but  we  have  never  lost  a  client because of conflict of interest.

If  anything,  I  consider  this  charge  something  of  a  back-handed compliment.  It's  a  sign  that  we've  done  a  pretty  good  job  of diversifying our experience.

## Staying in Business

I remember  hearing  a  once-popular  comedian  talk  about  the dramatic  rise  and  fall  of  his  career:  'You  know  the  old  adage,  'Be nice to people on the way up because you might meet them again on your way down'? Not true,' he said. 'On the way down you meet a totally different group.' I have found something of the same thing to be  true  about  building  a  business  and  running  one.  The  problems you meet are totally different.

The overall problem is that everything becomes harder. It's harder to  keep  a  company's  momentum,  to  shift  its  speed,  to  alter  its direction. It's harder to make decisions, because so many additional factors have to be considered, and it's harder to get them executed, because  you  are  rarely  talking  directly  to  the  people  who  will  be executing them.

But the biggest single problem, by far, is that the structures and systems created to make all this a little easier, to make it all flow a little smoother, begin to stifle the very momentum they are supposed to help.

## The Nature Of Systems

Ben Bidwell, now the executive vice-president of Chrysler, and the former head of North American Sales for the Ford Motor Company, once described to me Ford's structure - and the systems created to support it  -  as  a  'wall  of  molasses.  You  can't  get  anything  in.  You can't get anything out. You can't move up. You can't move sideways. It takes two years even to move down.'

I think this was less a comment on Ford than on the nature of any mature  organization.  During  the  period  of  rapid  growth,  when  a

company may be doubling or tripling in size each year, the growth itself  tends  to  make  the  structures  less  constrictive.  But  as  a company matures, and as its growth rate settles in to a steady 15% or 20% a year, systems and structures are allowed to take root, and they  begin  to  choke  the  life  out  of  the  organizations  that  seeded them.

This is the sinister uncompromising nature of systems. They ride roughshod over everything, especially common sense, and are the single  biggest  reason  why  working  for  a  company  can  often  be  a ludicrous  experience.  It  takes  for  ever  to  get  something  into  the system and, once it is in, it is almost impossible to get it back out.

John DeLorean told me that shortly after he had become General Manager of Chevrolet he attended a sales conference in Dallas, and when he arrived at his hotel suite he discovered that someone from the  company  had  delivered  a  huge  basket  of  fruit  to  his  room. Remarking  to  an  associate  on  the  basket's  size  and  variety  he commented, humorously, he thought, 'What? No bananas?'

From that moment on, the word throughout General Motors was 'John  DeLorean  loves  bananas.'  No  matter  how  many  times  he attempted to explain that he had only meant to be amusing, bananas kept  showing  up  in  cars,  chartered  planes,  hotel  suites  -  even  in meetings - and followed him throughout his career at Chevrolet.

Another  problem  with  systems  is  that  responsibility  is  passed along and down and around and eventually, when it finally reaches the  guy  who  is  actually  supposed  to  do  something,  someone  has invariably forgotten to tell him the reason.

In the early 1970s one of Arnold Palmer's endorsees was Lincoln Mercury, and I told Gar Laux, then the General Manager of Lincoln Mercury, that if he was interested we could arrange to use a couple of Lincolns as the photographic backdrop in a forthcoming series of Arnold's print ads for his apparel licensee, Robert Bruce.

Gar  was  delighted  by  this  opportunity  for  'free'  advertising  and said, 'Just let us know when and where you want the cars and well make sure they get there.'

Several  weeks  later  the  head  of  our  apparel  division  received  a call from a lower echelon Lincoln Mercury executive who wanted to know where the cars should be sent and what colours they should

be. 'Bermuda, three weeks from today,' our executive told him, but as  to  colour,  which  really  didn't  matter,  he  said,  'I  don't  know. Whatever you have. What about a navy and a maroon?'

Several days before the shoot, our apparel executive received a call  from  a  different  employee  at  Lincoln  Mercury,  who  this  time wanted  to  know  precisely  where  in  Bermuda  the  cars  should  be shipped.  'We've  had  to  charter  a  plane,'  he  said,  'because  our Bermuda dealer  doesn't  have  a  blue  or  a  maroon  car.  In  fact,'  he added, 'there's only one of each on the Eastern seaboard, and the plane first has to fly to Boston to pick up the maroon car and then to Washington to get the navy blue.'

Most of the best-run companies are not only aware of these sorts of system-created  problems,  but  they  focus  much  of  their management  energy  towards  breaking  the  stranglehold.  Perhaps this is where I could have benefited from a Harvard MBA, because nobody told us this. We had to figure it out for ourselves.

## Think Small

In our formative years there was so much going on, so much to do, we  really  didn't  have  time  to  think  that  much  about  systems, organization and structure, and we didn't really have to. Things just seemed  to  get  done,  and  getting  them  done  under  conditions  of barely organized chaos probably added to the excitement.

But it was becoming increasingly obvious that we couldn't continue to operate that way, especially after we began to diversify. I realized the nature of my job was changing as well and was likely to change even more. I was also spending more of my time on administration and less and less on everything else.

In order to alleviate some of this administrative burden, in order to eliminate  some  of  the  chaos,  and  in  order  to  grow  and  expand  in some  sensible  systematic  manner,  coming  up  with  a  structural framework became a major priority.

When we first  sat  down  to  discuss  structure  and  organization,  I knew that, while we weren't going to stay small, I wanted to preserve what I could of the 'small feeling' we had when we started out.

There is no other feeling like that in business, or at least any that I have ever experienced. It's not just the excitement, although that is certainly  part  of  it.  It  is  more  a  sense  of  the  immediacy  and importance  that  everything  takes  on,  the  feeling  that  what  you  do from day to day matters , and generates a desire to do even more.

It  also  brings  with  it  a  certain  amount  of  anxiety.  It's  hard  to  feel complacent in a tiny new company, because in the back of your mind you're  always  wondering  if  you're  still  going  to  be  around  in  six months. It puts an edge on everything you do. I wanted, if possible, to avoid a bureaucratic structure that would dull this edge.

There  is  also  an ésprit in  small  growing  companies  which  is difficult to explain to anyone who has never experienced it. I suspect it  is  not  unlike  the  feeling  one  gets  from  being  a  member  of  a champion sports team, a satisfaction that comes from contributing to something  larger  than  yourself.  In  the  early  days,  when  Arnold  or Gary  would  win  a  tournament  over  the  weekend,  everyone  would come in to work so pumped up Monday morning there would literally be races for the telephones. I knew, however, that if we were to grow we  would  soon  have  people  working  for  us  who  wouldn't  know  a putter from a wedge, much less who won over the weekend.

I  knew  this  special ésprit could  not  be  totally  preserved,  but certainly part of it could, and I wanted a structure that would help us achieve  that.  The  key,  I  felt,  was  to  think  small,  to  structure something that would make everyone feel like a very big cog in his or her respective wheel.

Our response was to organize the company into a group of twelve smaller  companies,  each  functioning  as  a  separate  autonomous profit  centre,  but  each  with  additional  responsibilities  to  other companies within the group and to the group at large as well. The primary  responsibility  of  our  golf  company,  for  instance,  was representing our professional golf clients. Yet its overall responsibilities  included  any  golf-related  activities,  which  translated into  specific  functions  within  several  of  our  other  companies, including fashion, television, financial management and publishing.

I felt  this  structure  would  lend  a  sense  of  immediacy  and importance to everyone's role within the company. As we grew, I also felt the interconnections would reduce the need for more and more

layers  of  management  to  co-ordinate  these  various  intra-group activities.

The result was a structure that looked less like a single pyramid than  a  row  of  small  pyramids.  In  the  beginning  some  of  these pyramids  were very  small , consisting  of  one  executive  and  a secretary.  As  we  have  grown,  one  of  these  original  companies became  a  staff  function  and  others  have  been  sub-divided  into additional  companies  or  new  autonomous  divisions.  But  otherwise they function pretty much today as they were conceived back then.

## Don't Let Structures Run The Operation

The  fluidity  of  business  is  simply  too  fast  and  too  formless  for existing systems and structures to hold it. Once our structures were in  place  we  began  an  ongoing  process  of  ignoring  them.  I  believe this  is  one  of  the  greatest  challenges  to  almost  any  established company - a constant recognition that you often have to jump out of existing structures in order to let new business in.

I  understand  that  this  is  the  way  IBM  developed  its  Peanut computer. They took some of their brightest minds, put them outside existing structures and rules and told them to get on with it. I suspect most revolutionary technological and business advancements were created outside, or substantially outside, an existing structure.

I  am  often  confronted  by  executives  in  our  own  company  who would like nothing more than to have everything neatly compartmentalized.  Even  if  they  recognize  the  validity  of  what  is being  discussed  or  understand  the  larger  picture,  their  minds demand  order  and  conformity  to  the  systems  and  their  'yes'  is invariably followed by a 'but': ' Yes, but whose budget will this come out of?' ' Yes, but where am I going to get the manpower?' ' Yes, but who's  going  to  oversee  it?'  I  suppose  there  were  a  lot  of  division managers at IBM who went into a mild state of shock when informed that their number two or three guy was being plucked away for some special project.

But good management must resist both the internal and external pressures to force new business into the old holes, simply because

those holes already exist. Once a company allows structure to run its operation,  it  is  only  a  few  missed  opportunities  away  from  total stagnation.

## Think Flexibility

You have to sell the flexibility of the structure to the people who work for you, and the only way this can be done is by deeds rather than words.  Your  employees  have  to  see  the  tangible  proof  that  the structure  is  not  only  flexible,  but  that  this  flexibility  works  to  their advantage and their self-interest.

This was one of our considerations in the initial line structuring of our  organization.  I  wanted  to  be  able  to  pull  two  people  from Company A and two people from Company B to start Company C, or to  take  someone  from  Company  C  to  head  up  a  special  project affecting Companies A, B and C.

However, I also wanted the people within the structure to feel this flexibility. I wanted them to know that we were going to try out good ideas,  no  matter  who  thought  of  them,  no  matter  how  directly  or indirectly  these  ideas  applied  to  their  division  or  to  their  specific areas of responsibility. I also wanted them to know that if someone came up with a good workable idea, that idea was not simply going to be handed over to someone else. Whoever conceived it would be involved in its execution.

Our  entry  into  the  creation,  implementation  and  televising  of specialized sports events has given us our best opportunity for doing this,  for showing the  system's  flexibility  and  letting  those  within  the system feel it.  These  events  often  involve  a  co-ordinated  effort between  five  or  six  of  our  companies.  Each  event  varies  from  the next,  and  though  we  have  now  created  more  than  fifty  events  we have yet to create a structure to define what they are, who's doing them or how they are supposed to work.

Last year one of those events was a 'Master of Hockey' contest which  pitted  a  team  of  Hockey  Hall  of  Famers  against  a  team  for former Boston Bruins stars. It was staged at a jam-packed sold-out Boston Gardens, and while the event was administered by our team

sports division, which also provided the players, the idea itself came from one of our tennis executives who was made responsible for its overall execution.

Because we are always practising flexibility rather than preaching it,  I  suspect  we  are  less  a  victim  of  our  own  systems  than  many companies are. Recently, when I told Ben Bidwell that I was working on  a  book  of  business  advice,  he  said,  'Mark,  you  only  have  one secret:  IMG  spends  90%  of  its  time  on  business,  and  10%  on organization.'

## Reserve The Right To Be Arbitrary

As Chairman, President and CEO of IMG, I reserve the right to be arbitrary.  Because of our company structure, and the flexibility and fluidity I try to maintain, I exercise this right with some regularity.

Our executives will often baulk at a decision I have made because it  doesn't seem fair or because it violates certain assumptions they have  made  about  how  the  company  works.  I  have,  on  occasion, made  decisions  or  proposed  solutions  which  were  equally unsatisfactory to all parties.

Yet  I  can  think  of  many  reasons  why  I  reserve  this  right  and hundreds of situations where I have had to use it. I may know certain facts that totally alter the face of a situation, and yet the time has not come  to  share  these  facts  with  others.  I  may  have  to  make  a decision  which  is  good  for  the  Group  in  the  long  term  but  may penalize  one  of  our  companies  in  the  short  run.  Sometimes  the decision affects something we will definitely be doing in the future. Sometimes it affects something we may or may not be doing in the future, but is needed to give us the option.

I  must reserve the right to be arbitrary because, as CEO, one of my prime responsibilities to the company itself, and by extension the people  who  work  for  it,  is  to  provide  awareness  for  growth  and protect  the  future.  And  the  best  decisions  for  doing  this  are  not always the fairest or the most popular ones.

## Don't Let Policies Stifle The Operation

We  are  always  revising  and  updating  our  corporate  policies, dropping some and adding others, in an effort to keep our company management abreast with the company itself. Our corporate policy committee meets regularly  once  a  quarter  for  this  purpose.  I  chair these  meetings  myself,  and  I  think  what  comes  out  of  them  is  so important I schedule the rest of my itinerary around them in order not to miss one.

If structures create a drag on business momentum, then outdated, outmoded policies create a drag on the business itself. This seems obvious  to  me.  Yet  on  countless  occasions  I  have  run  into corporations  in  which  some  ridiculously  restrictive  policy  prevented them  from  doing  something  they  actually  wanted  to  do.  When pressed for the reasons behind some of these policies, I have seen chairmen  of  boards  shrug  their  shoulders  and  confess  they  didn't remember, or wonder out loud why such a policy ever existed in the first place.

I recently read that a jogger in Palm Beach, Florida, was arrested for  jogging  on  a  street  that  ran  north  and  south.  Apparently  some town  ordinance  which  had  been  on  the  books  for  more  than  fifty years permitted running only on east/west thoroughfares.

Little titbits like this pop up every now and then in the newspapers. Someone  discovers  some  obscure,  ancient  county  or  state ordinance  which  prohibits  public  gum  chewing  or  singing  in elevators. We laugh at the absurdity of these laws and wonder how anyone ever thought them up. Yet I  would  venture  there  are  rules which  are  equally  absurd  and  equally  outdated  in  the  corporate policy manuals of many major American corporations.

A  company's  unofficial  policies  can  be  just  as  bizarre  and  even more damaging. Policies are the day-to-day laws of the corporation; the danger you run with unofficial policies is that people may follow them.

I have a friend who runs a small business. His unofficial policy is to pay all creditors within fifteen business days. He was attempting to buy into another business and had secured a substantial loan from the bank for this purpose. He was in Europe when the loan arrived,

and when he returned to his office three weeks later he discovered his accounting department had paid off every outstanding invoice with the money he had just borrowed from the bank.

The  corporate  policies  which  I  often  find  to  be  the  most shortsighted  are  the  'precedent  policies',  whereby  a  company's desire to protect a minor precedent will result in the loss of a major opportunity.

When  we  were  attempting  to  negotiate  Arnold's  equipment contract  with  Wilson  Sporting  Goods  back  in  the  early  1960s,  my counterparts at Wilson and I had spent a great deal of time coming up  with  an  insurance  clause  we  all  felt  we  could  live  with.  But someone  at  Wilson  suggested  that  this  clause  would  never  get approved  by  Judge  Cooney,  the  Wilson  Meat  Packing  Company's crotchety old boss, because it was unprecedented; if they approved this for Arnold, they would have to offer the same plan to all Wilson employees.  (Our  insurance  man  answered  with  a  wonderful  letter suggesting  that  Wilson should offer  this  plan  to  all  qualifying employees, the qualification being that they win the Masters and the US Open in the same year!)

As it turned out, the Wilson guy was right. Judge Cooney refused to  sign  the  new contract, and the insurance clause was one of the main reasons. This enabled Arnold to get out of his agreement with Wilson and to found his own sporting goods company. I would guess that precedent has cost Wilson millions of dollars.

The  most  bizarre  encounter  I  have  ever  had  with  another company's policies occurred in the early 1970s.

General Motors had a rule against any direct financial involvement in  the sport of motor racing. At the same time, because of racing's overall  importance  to  the  automotive  industry,  they  did  support  it indirectly.

Pete  Estes,  who  was  General  Manager  of  Chevrolet  at  the  time (he  later  became  GM's  Chairman),  and  Chevrolet's  agency, Campbell-Ewald, had been working with us for almost six months to finalize a very complex deal with Jean-Claude Killy. The core of the agreement  was  a  television  series  starring  Killy  which  Chevrolet would  sponsor,  but  which  involved  a  number  of  other  contractual obligations  as  well,  including  a  commitment  from  Killy  to  drive  a

Corvette in the most famous of all endurance races, the twenty-four hours of Le Mans.

Killy  had  actually  become  quite  excited  about  this  particular commitment when I began to hear rumblings out of Detroit that all was not well at Chevrolet.

Word  had  come  down  from  the  Chairman  of  GM  that  under  no circumstances was Killy to get behind the wheel of a Corvette at Le Mans, that if necessary Chevrolet was to pay off the agreement in full  and  cancel  it.  Chevrolet  was  quite  embarrassed  by  this,  and offered to commit to six additional television shows, to honour all its other commitments, and even to finance Killy's Le Mans race - as long  as  he  did  not  drive  a  Corvette  or  any  other  General  Motors product.

Killy participated in Le Mans that year, and fulfilled his commitment to Chevrolet - by driving a Porsche.

## Manage Unconventionally

Managing  a  mature  company  is  not  just  a  constant  process  of breaking out of archaic structures and antiquated policies. You also have to be consciously, actively and aggressively punching holes in the company's conventions and conventional wisdom.

It's  too  easy  to  say,  'It's  worked  this  way  before',  or  'This  is  how we've always done it.' It's too easy to get mentally locked in, to reject automatically a fresh or new approach.

Companies,  by  nature,  are  conservative.  People  resist  change, particularly  in  the  working  environment.  They  would like  to  feel  the company they are working for now will look pretty much the same five years from now.

This is why breaking out is always a fight. You are going against the grain. The irony is that a mature company gains momentum by pushing against the flow of the exising momentum.

Have  you  noticed  that  the  best  run  companies  all  seem  to  be managed  unconventionally?  Every  time  they  are  written  up  or profiled  in  a  business  magazine,  their  success  is  attributed  to breaking  the  rules,  not  following  them;  for  encouraging  employee,

departmental and divisional independence, not stifling it; for bursting through the conventional wisdom, not perpetuating it.

Manage unconventionally.  Don't  just  look  for  opportunities  to  do the  unexpected.  Create  them.  Aggressively  pursue  change.  Make managing an active verb.

Recently, I had occasion to replace the head of one of our most important divisions, International Television Sales, which includes the licensing  of  television  rights  to  many  of  the  world's  major  sporting events.  There  were  a  number  of  qualified  candidates  within  our television company, but I chose an executive from our skiing division.

It was an opportunity to try something new, to do the unexpected, and  in  the  eighteen  months  since  the  profits  in  that  division  have substantially increased.

## Manage With Confidence

It is the ability to delegate which, more than anything else, separates the good managers from the bad ones.

Delegation is the process of building up people, then letting go of a responsibility. It sounds easy, but it almost never is. Egos get in the way. People would rather be perceived as the authority than support the authority or expertise of the people who work for them.

It  is  also  difficult  to  let  go  of  a  responsibility.  Again,  it's  often  a matter  of  ego.  People  convince  themselves  that  they  can  do something better than anyone else, or are afraid that if they give up a task or responsibility they will be perceived as being less essential to the company.

It takes a very confident person to be a good manager, confidence in the people who work for you and enough confidence in yourself to overcome these ego problems.

It is human nature to want to see the fruits of your labour, to feel the  dirt  between  your  fingers,  to  perform  tasks  which  not  only produce  tangible  results  but  which  are  themselves  tangible. Managers must seek a different kind of satisfaction. They have got to be able to build up people and give them responsibilities, to find ego gratification in training, directing and overseeing others.

## Delegate What You Can, Not What You Want To

We have several  executives  who  are  still  performing  certain  tasks which should have been delegated to others a long time ago. These tasks are not the best use of these executives' time, they all could be performed equally well by people working for them … and they all involve  spending several days several times a year in a resort-like area for the purposes of entertaining corporate clients or producing some of our television shows. As far as I'm concerned, these aren't 'tasks' but corporate  perks  these  executives  have  awarded themselves.

The  reverse  of  this  is  even  more  common.  In  fact,  there  is  an expression  about  the  tendency  of  certain  viscous  matter  to  flow downhill  that  is  used  to  describe  it.  Freely  translated,  it  says:  'The more distasteful a task, the further down it is going to be delegated.' One  of  Federal  Express's  early  television  commercials  showed  a package  being  handed  down  from  one  level  of  a  company  to  the next until the person with the final responsibility for mailing it was five or six people removed from the person who was sending it. The first time I saw that commercial I remember thinking I'm glad I'm not the guy on top of that totem pole.

People will often delegate - or fail to delegate - for all the wrong reasons. They hold on to a task because they like doing it, or want to do it, or are afraid not to do it, and they will pass down some other task  because  they  find  it  distasteful  or  'beneath  them',  or  have rationalized that it is not the best use of their time.

All  sorts  of  business  considerations  have  to  be  weighed  when determining what should and should not be delegated.

During the early years of my representation of Arnold Palmer, if he wanted a pair of golf shoes sent to him in Houston he would not call the shoe manufacturer, he would not call the director of our golf or apparel divisions, he would not call his secretary or my secretary. He would  call  me.  And  for  reasons  of  loyalty,  and  the  ongoing importance of our relationship, I took care of it.

I  mentioned this one day to Lew Wasserman, Chairman of MCA, and one of my early business mentors, and I was happily surprised when he said that, indeed, was the way it should be. 'When Jules

Stein founded MCA back in 1924,' Wasserman said, 'his first client was  bandleader  Guy  Lombardo.  Thirty  years  later,  under  Jules's leadership,  MCA  had  grown  into  the  world's  largest  entertainment company.  But  when  Lombardo  called,  Jules  would  still  handle  it personally.  We  would  be  waiting  for  a  board  meeting  to  start,  and Jules would be on the phone with Guy Lombardo, discussing what arrangement he should play that night from the rooftop room at the Roosevelt Hotel in New Orleans.'

## Hire People Smarter Than Yourself

Wasserman and I continued talking about how MCA had grown into a billion-dollar corporation, how IMG might also be able to grow and, by extension, how an understanding of delegation would make that happen.

As we took on new clients I could not be expected personally to handle the golf shoes, the tennis racquets or the skis for all of them. This seemed  fairly  obvious,  but  when  you  are  discussing representation  with  athletes  who  are  the  best  in  the  world  at  their particular  sports  it  may  not  seem  so  obvious  to  them.  'Hire  people who are smarter than you are,' Wasserman said to me, 'then don't sell yourself, sell your company.'

Obviously,  I  don't  believe  that  everyone  we've  ever  hired  is smarter than I, but I can honestly say that I would not want to match my  expertise  in  fashion,  tennis,  television,  skiing,  football,  etc. against the people who are running these divisions for us. And I truly do believe that the clients being represented by these divisions are in much better hands than if I was representing them personally. This is  what  makes  it  easy  for  me  now  to  sell  my  company  rather  than myself.

One  of  the  difficulties  with  delegation  is  that  managers  will sometimes  paint  themselves  as  the  experts  rather  than  as  expert managers. Sell your division rather than yourself, and you will find more of a willingness among others outside your company to work with your subordinates. The smarter you make the people who work

for  you  look,  the  smarter  you  are  going  to  look  as  a  manager.  It's also less masochistic.

## Take Five Hours To Save Five Minutes

Several months ago I participated in a pro-am tennis exhibition. Just before  we  were  to  go  on  the  court,  I  happened  to  overhear  a conversation between our opponents. The pro, who was one of the top-ranked players in the world, said to his amateur partner, 'Do you want to win this match or do you just want to play some tennis?'

The  amateur,  who  was  a  little  intimidated,  replied  rather sheepishly, 'Well, I guess I would like to win the match.'

'Fine,' the pro said. 'Then serve and get off the court!'

This  may  have  been  the  way  for  the  pro  to  win  that  particular match, but it is hardly the best strategy for building a strong doubles team against tough competition over the long term.

I chuckled to myself at the time, but aren't there a lot of people in business  guilty  of  this  same  attitude?  They  would  rather  do  it themselves  than  take  the  time  to  teach  someone  else  to  do  it  for them. They feel they could be most effective if everyone else would just get out of their way.

I  recently  asked  one  of  our  executives  how  a  new  employee  he had hired was getting along. 'He'll work out just fine,' he said, 'but right  now  it's  frustrating.  It  takes  me  five  hours  to  show  him something I could do myself in five minutes.'

That one statement underscores:

- 1. The biggest stumbling block to delegation.
- 2. A big reason for unfounded resentment towards subordinates.
- 3. The importance of training.
- 4. The need to keep a trained employee.
- 5. A good reason why companies don't grow.

Fortunately,  even  though  it  was  frustrating  him,  this  particular executive understood the mathematics of delegation. Five hours now could save him hundreds of hours in the future.

So many people in management fail to appreciate this very simple arithmetic.  Either  they  underestimate  the  importance  of  training  or lack  the  patience  to  deal  with  it.  Some  managers,  I  believe,  don't understand  that,  in  teaching  someone  else  to  do  the  job  they  are doing,  they  are  freeing  up  their  own  time  for  more  important  tasks and greater responsibilities.

These  managers  are  usually  the  ones  who  end  up  staying  in  a company's middle echelons. They are too busy doing all the other jobs they should have trained others to do, and too 'valuable' doing them to take on any larger roles in their companies.

## Management Philosophies Don't Work

Most management philosophy that you read in a book or learn in a classroom is going to have limited effectiveness. Once you factor in human beings  -  egos  and  personalities  -  even  the  most  sensible theories  begin  to  fall  apart.  It  is  like  the  ancient  children's  game, Paper, Scissors, Stone'. Management philosophies and management theories are always topped by Real Life.

The only management philosophy that does work is the one that acknowledges  what  none  of  them  does:  be  flexible  and  strive  for consistency.

Flexibility  is  probably  the  one  word  that  most  closely  defines  my approach to management. I have found that as soon as I begin to accept anything as gospel, I run into the heretics - people or pieces of information that burst my comfortable convictions.

If IMG had adhered to the gospel as we know it, we would not be in the modelling agency business today, nor would we have our team sports division.

But flexibility is not just rethinking your business. It must extend to all aspects of management, from how often you re-evaluate policies to  how  receptive  you  are  to  listening  to  what  your  employees  are telling you.

As a company, we are so decentralized and scattered around the world that for a couple of years all our executives were required to submit weekly activity reports, similar to time sheets kept by lawyers,

with copies going to all parties with a need to know. I felt this was a pretty  good  idea,  and  still  feel  it  is,  but  what  I  found  out  was  that there was a tremendous resistance to these reports. They were timeconsuming  and,  because  a  few  executives  began  to  use  them  as weapons, others began to feel the need to cover themselves. What began as a good idea became a terrible one. So we made them bimonthly. Flexibility may be more than just a management 'approach'. If  you're  responsive  to  the  people  who  work  for  you,  it  may  be  an obligation.

## Manage For Consistency

Most  companies,  I  assume,  would  prefer  to  grow  steadily  at  a healthy rate, rather than doubling in size one year and losing money the next. No one can manage this kind of schizophrenia effectively with  any  long-term  success,  and  no  one  should  try.  Next  to profitability,  the  most  important  goal  a  company should strive for is consistency.

If  flexibility  is  the  means, then consistency - of performance and growth - is the end. This sounds like something of a contradiction. If one is being flexible how can one be consistent? In fact, they are not only  compatible,  but  a  flexible,  responsive  management  virtually guarantees  consistency.  It  is  inflexibility that causes  erratic behaviour. A company goes on for too long adhering to all the old rules  and  outdated  modes  of  performance.  Then  one  morning someone wakes up, panics, over-reacts, and throws out all the rules. That can make people nuts.

To manage consistently you have to behave consistently. Even if people don't like what you are saying, they still want to know where you are coming from.

I  have  tried  to  be  consistent  in  emphasizing  what  I  think  is important and what I think is insignificant. There's a certain solace in that. Inconsistency in management breeds all sorts of unnecessary anxieties in the people being managed. There are enough legitimate anxieties  without  adding  to  them  by  not  letting  people  know  where you are coming from.

There are any number of things that the people who work for me don't like about the way I run my company, and I'm sure this is true of any company that hasn't been thoroughly committee-ized and is still being run by a boss. But the things they don't like now are pretty much the same things they didn't like ten years ago.

## Dealing With Employees

The  whole  idea  of  managing  for  consistency  brings  up  another seeming contradiction which, to me anyway, embodies the 'artistic' aspect of management:  what  happens  when  policy  meets personality?  How  do  you  get  people  to  perform  consistently  when people, by nature, act so inconsistently?

Basically, people aren't inconsistent, but their behaviour is.

The way they feel about their jobs from week to week is seldom a literal reflection of what they really feel or of the job they are actually doing. They are either over-satisfied or under-satisfied depending on how things  are  going,  the  breaks  they  are  getting,  and  the  results they  are  seeing.  Managing  for  consistency  where  people  are involved demands being 'consistently inconsistent'. Sometimes you have to build people up. And sometimes you have to bring people down.

Much  has  been  said  and  written  lately  about  the  success  of 'people oriented' companies. These companies talk a lot about being part of the 'team' or 'family' and have slogans like 'people first, then profits'.  Obviously,  you  manage  through  people  but  implicit  in  this approach  is  the  idea  that  you  always  get  the  most  out  of  people through positive motivation.

I don't buy this, and I suspect a lot of other people who would like to  believe  it  don't  buy  it  either.  If  everyone  were  the  same,  if everyone responded to the same carrot, then this would make more sense. But it doesn't ring true, because it is only half the solution.

In the real world no two people are motivated precisely the same way  or  by  exactly  the  same  things,  and  no  individual  works  on  a totally even keel. Even the steadiest performers have their ups and downs.

I  have  four  general  philosophies  for  dealing  with  employees:  1) Pay Them What They Are Worth; 2) Make Them Feel That They Are Important,  yet  3)  Make  Them  Think  For  Themselves,  and  4) Separate Office Life From Social Life.

## PAY THEM WHAT THEY ARE WORTH

Very few people are worth very much to a company at the beginning. Everyone is being overpaid, but the overpayment is an investment in the person and in the future. We do not pay people well to begin with -  we  want  them  to  prove  themselves.  We  pay  very  well  after  they have  proved  themselves.  Since  I  was  fortunate  enough  to  make pretty  good  money  at  a  fairly  young  age,  I  have  no  psychological hang-ups about the people who work for me making a lot of money at  a  very  young  age.  Before  they  do,  however,  I  want  them  to perform well, and to be deserving of it.

It is important to split away the ego factor in salary levels from true worth  and  real  contribution.  It  is  equally  important  to  make  the employee realize  that  this  is  what  you  are  doing  and  to  make  the employee  realize  further  the  value  of  his  job.  If,  for  example,  a corporate policy gives bonuses secured from airline travel while on company  business,  and  the  employee  is  free  to  use  these  airline bonuses for himself or his family, then make sure that he knows that this is part of his compensation. Be sure that if an employee ties a vacation  into  a  business  trip  that  he  knows  the  value  of  that  or, conversely, what the vacation would have cost had there not been a business trip. Do not let an employee forget these examples when he starts saying, 'All I am making from this job is X dollars.'

I  strive  to  keep  a  dynamic  interaction  going  between  myself  and the people who work for me. As an employer, I have always tried to be  generous  with  people  in  the  area  of  fringe  benefits,  but  I  want both of us to know that I am being generous.

## MAKE THEM FEEL THAT THEY ARE IMPORTANT - YET MOTIVATE BOTH POSITIVELY AND NEGATIVELY

It is very important to build employees up, make them feel important and let them get credit for things that they have accomplished. It is important that you give them this credit directly and openly to their

peers  and  to  the  outside  world.  As  you  do  this,  however,  it  is important to  teach  them  the  'we'  of  the  situation.  Motivate  them  to keep  selling  the  company  while  at  the  same  time  taking  credit  for their  particular  accomplishment.  There  is  nothing  worse  than  an executive  who  tries  to  take  credit  personally  for  something  his subordinates or assistants have done.

While  being  free  with  your  praise,  never  let  people  rest  on  their laurels,  become  complacent  and  feel  that  a  good  accomplishment one  week  allows  them  to  get  away  with  almost  anything  in  future weeks.

Sometimes  you  can  motivate  good  employees  to  be  better  by pointing  out  their  minor  shortcomings  and  urging  them  to  even greater heights. This is what I call negative motivation.

In  the  real  world,  part  of  'playing  for  a  winner'  -  as  any  football coach  can  tell  you  -  sometimes  means  bolstering  a  team's  selfconfidence  and  sometimes  means  bringing  the  players  down  a couple of notches. Sometimes it can mean straight intimidation: 'Do you measure up?' 'Are you good enough to play for this team?'

As in  most  companies,  our  employees  have  more  than  one  job, more  than  one  area  of  responsibility.  If  one  of  our  executives  is feeling pretty terrific about something, I'll sometimes tend to bring up one of those areas where things aren't going so well. If he's down on himself, it's easy enough for me to find something he's doing right.

People who really care about what they do - and I think most of our executives are in that category - tend to work in emotional peaks and  valleys.  Consistency  of  management  and  consistency  of performance is achieved by filling in those valleys, and lopping off a peak every now and then.

I recently came across a very unfavourable review of a television series  our  company  is  producing.  Though  I  hadn't  seen  the  show myself,  I  sent  the  review  to  several  of  our  TV  executives,  with  the following  one-line  memo:  'If  the  attached  represents  the  kind  of reviews  we  are  getting  around  the  country,  we  better  rip  up  our concept and start again.'

I think it is important to keep your employees slightly off balance, even at  the  cost  of  occasional  unfairness.  I  think  it  is  important  to

make  people  aware  of  their  mistakes,  even  if  this  means  some occasional second guessing.

One  of  the  biggest  enemies  of  established  companies  is complacency. You have to keep the edge in, and if the people who work for you feel too secure or too self-satisfied,  that  is  when  you lose the edge.

As an employer, I want people to feel they have to measure up, to be 'good enough' to work for us. If someone is particularly pleased with a deal he or she has done, I will commend that employee for it but I might also say, 'Who has foreign rights?' or 'Why didn't we do such-and-such?'  or  bring  up  something  else  that  will  send  them away thinking, 'Why didn't I think of that?' and leave them a little less complacent, over-confident or self-satisfied.

Obviously, there are times when you have to do just the opposite. There are times when you have to build people up, give them a pat on the back, and help them get things in perspective.

I spoke not too long ago with one of our executives who had really been  having  a  streak  of  bad  luck.  One  of  his  clients,  a  leading athlete, had been threatening to leave for about six months. And he had just returned from the Orange Bowl football game, where he had gone to sign up the Heismann Trophy winner, Mike Rozier. We had received  verbal  commitments  from  him  and  family  members  but, although subsequently denied by the player, it appeared that he had accepted money from another agent who could have exposed this fact if Rozier did not sign with him.

Needless to say, the executive, who had spent months pursuing these two players, and had done everything in the proper and ethical way,  was  devastated.  When  I  spoke  to  him,  I  pointed  out  that  he should be pleased with his effort regardless of the results, that we were not going to get down in the gutter with anyone, and that the admirable way in which he had conducted himself was of far greater value to the company.

## MAKE THEM THINK FOR THEMSELVES

The 'Kinda-Sorta' School of Management. Very often people say that my 'management style', if you want to call it that, is to encourage all

of our employees, at all levels, to think for themselves. I believe in this one; it goes straight to the bottom line.

When one of our executives comes to me with a specific problem or  question,  I'll  often  answer  non-specifically:  '….  when  we  did  the such-and-such deal with so-and-so we kinda said that if they could do this then we might be able to do that. Isn't there a way that we can kinda do that sorta thing here …?'

With  due  acknowledgement  to  Socrates  and  Harvard  Business School, it kinda works.

A  few  years  ago  we  were  trying  to  sign  a  British  television personality,  and  the  executive  in  charge  of  the  project  was  having some  difficulties  in  negotiating  the  specific  points  because  the prospective  client  was  raising  a  lot  of  objections  to  our  fees.  The executive asked me how I thought he should handle it. I suggested three or four approaches - ranging from conceding to taking a hard line  and  risking  losing  the  client  -  and  then  I  suggested  that  there had been times in the past when we knew that we would do a good job  and  we  would tell  the  client,  'Let's  not  resolve  the  fee  now  but let's work it out in a while when we've worked for you and you can pay us what you think it's worth.'

From the way I presented it, it was pretty clear that this was the way I felt he should approach the problem, but I left the decision of how to approach the problem in such a way that he believed that it was his solution not mine.

We signed the client.

## SEPARATE OFFICE LIFE FROM SOCIAL LIFE

My  overriding  philosophy  on  this  one  is  to  minimize  the  relations outside the office. I will never forget when Arnold Palmer, who is just about as nice a person as you will ever want to meet, had a pilot who was really a very good pilot but not exactly the sort of person you wanted to spend your evenings with, let alone have attend business meetings with  you.  Arnold,  however,  could  not  bring  himself  to  tell the pilot he would see him the next day, since he thought that was not being very nice and that the pilot would somehow be offended. Then came a meeting with a golf game manufacturer from Kansas City  and  the  pilot  attended  -  and  started  making  comments  about

the nature of the game and the sort of contract that there ought to be. I will never forget the expression on Arnold's face. Needless to say,  it  was  the  last  time  that  the  pilot  spent  evenings  with  us  or attended meetings.

Socializing within the office is certainly better undone than done. In the very early days of IMG when we were only a very few, we just plain  did  not  permit  it.  Times  change  and  the  work  changes  and there is very little that one can do to forbid it on any level. It does, however, create a lot of very obvious problems.

It  is  impossible  to  let  your  hair  down  with  someone  one  evening and  try  to  be  completely  yourself  if  the  next  day  you  have  got  to reprimand, fire, reassign or in some other way interact on a business basis with that person. Nor can the employee turn off from the night before to the next day.

As  a  general  rule,  one  is  better  off  by  miles  not  complicating  a business relationship within the company  by  all sorts of undercurrents  from  various  social  interactions.  When  somebody  is having  a  relationship,  it  opens  an  entire  range  of  confidentiality problems, for the personal relationship, in all but a few circumstances, will override the business situation and confidentiality.

## FIRING PEOPLE

There  are  many  ways  to  fire  people.  Henry  Ford  told  Bunkie Knudsen,  'It  just  didn't  work  out,'  and  a  couple  of  years  later allegedly said to Lee Iacocca, 'I just don't like you.' Bill Paley of CBS reportedly  decided  one  day  that  his  whiz-kid  programmer,  Jim Aubrey,  was  'just  not  the  kind  of  guy  I  want  to  run  this  company when I retire'.

These  firings  were  sudden  and  unexpected,  which,  totally  apart from  the  question  of  their  legitimacy,  is  cause  enough  to  question how they were handled. Whenever I hear that someone has been fired  out  of  the  blue,  I  suspect  it  is  emotional  over-reaction  rather than the result of a considered business judgement.

When I know I will have to fire a particular person, I consider two factors - timing and that person's loyalty to the company.

You must fire someone when it hurts you the least both externally and  internally.  This  can  be  anywhere  from  immediately  to,  in  one case I can recall, two years later. As a general rule in our business, where relationships with clients can often be strong and personal, a certain amount of preparation is usually necessary.

One  must  also  be  sensitive  to  the  feelings  of  the  person  being fired - helping him or her to save face. The degree to which I take this into account is determined by that person's loyalty and service to the company.

Before firing people who have been loyal, you owe it to them first to exhaust all other possibilities - a lateral shift, the creation of a new job more compatible to their skills, even a disguised demotion. If no such avenue exists, then you must give them time to 'adjust' to the idea  of  being  fired,  and  do  whatever  you  can  to  help  them  find another job.

In several instances I have fired people without their even knowing it. Instead, I have found jobs for them and let another company 'steal them away'.

At the other end of the spectrum, if I have good reason to believe that an employee is either disloyal or can't be trusted, then I will get him out of the company as quickly and as efficiently as I can.

We  once  had  an  employee  who,  I  discovered,  was  planning  to leave anyway and was going to take with him everything he could clients, files, and any confidential information he could lay his hands on.  I  also  had  reason  to  believe  that  he  would  be  vindictive  and, once he was fired, would do whatever he could on the outside to hurt us. It took us about two weeks to protect our flanks. We arranged for this employee to take a one-day trip to Detroit. While he was gone we had the locks changed, his files and records removed, and when he returned we fired him.

The  'vindictive  factor'  alone  is  enough  to  make  firing  anyone  a careful  and  considered  judgement,  and  companies  should  be cautious  about  burning  their  bridges.  A  bitter  ex-employee  can  do great harm. He is considered a credible source to the outside world even if what he is saying totally lacks credibility.

But  when  people  feel  they  have  been  fired  'fairly'  -  treated  with dignity, respect and sensitivity in what, by definition, is a demeaning

experience - they will be reluctant to bad mouth their ex-company. And they just may - as has happened to us on several occasions become valued future business associates.

## CONSULTANTS

If  your  company  has  hired  a  consultant  (financial,  management, whatever) and you are not taking his advice - fire him.

This is no reflection on the consultant. He may be giving you the best advice you will ever get, but if you are not following it you are wasting his time and your money.

## Lead By Example

I suppose I am not the easiest person in the world to work for. I can be  very  demanding  of  our  management  executives.  But  I  am  also very demanding of myself.

If  you  ask  a  subordinate  to  come  in  at  7  a.m.  in  the  morning  or stay until 10 p.m. at night, he or she is going to be a lot less reluctant to do this if he knows that you have gotten up at 5 a.m. that morning or  will  be  staying  until  11  p.m.  that  night  yourself.  If  you  call  that same employee from a yacht on the French Riviera and suggest the same thing, it's probably going to leave a different impression.

Just  because  it's  a  cliché  doesn't  mean  it's  any  less  true:  don't demand from  your  employees  anything  that  you  aren't  demanding from yourself.

## Ignore The Doomsayers

Companies  can  sometimes  get  into  new  businesses  for  defensive reasons  -  to  protect  their  flanks  or  as  an  over-reaction  to competition.

Every company has its corporate doomsayers who will try to get you to do exactly this. They will say, 'If we don't get into such-andsuch a business, then all sorts of terrible things are going to happen. We're probably too late as it is.' Obviously, these people don't have

the  interest  of  the  company  at  heart.  They  are  only  interested  in creating  can't-lose  situations  for  themselves:  they  have  already taken  credit  for  anticipated  success,  and  they've  already  covered themselves for anticipated failure.

When the reasons are defensive it almost never works. You know going in that the effort is going to be greater than the rewards, which in itself creates a self-fulfilling failure.

Frank Bennack, Chairman of Hearst, told me that a few years ago he was having to resist all sorts of internal pressure to get into the video games business. Video games were the future, he was told, and  for  a  communications/entertainment  company  not  to  have  a position in this industry would be a disaster.

Much  to  his  credit,  he  resisted.  If  he  had  listened  to  the doomsayers,  today  Hearst  would  be  giving  away  some  version  of 'Donkey Kong' with a subscription to Good Housekeeping.

## Get Beneath The Party Line

Several years ago, Chris Lewinton, Managing Director of Wilkinson Sword, gave me some very good advice about running a company. 'Get to know the people two levels down from you,' he said. 'That's where your future is going to be, and it will give a better idea about the present.'

CEOs, and managers on down the line, can often become isolated from what is really going on in their own companies. They talk to the same people over and over again, usually the numbers one and two in each division. Generally the manager and his assistant will share the  same  viewpoint.  They  will  make  decisions  together  and  sell those decisions together to upper management.

But getting to know the people one level below that can be an eyeopener. They will often have a refreshingly different take on what is going  on  and  on  what  you  are  being  told.  These  views  may  be slanted, or just as self-serving as anyone else's, but it helps to have a range of viewpoints rather than the same old party line.

## Go For Profit

Samuel Johnson once said, 'There are few ways in which a man can be more innocently employed than in getting money.'

Maybe  the  largest  problem  of  established  companies  is  their bigness.  The  bigger  the  company,  the  easier  it  is  to  get  off  on tangents, and forget why you are in business in the first place, which is to make a profit.

I  have  an  acquaintance  who  started  a  fabulously  successful business which literally grew exponentially - nearly 6000% - during its  first  eight  years.  Almost  overnight  he  was  beset  by  all  the problems  this  out  of  control  growth  creates,  and  he  began  to experiment  with  all  sorts  of  solutions,  from  bringing  in  a  new management team to totally restructuring the company, to getting out of  certain  aspects  of  his  business,  to  selling  it  and  getting  out entirely. As you might expect, he went through a couple of very bad years while these experiments were going on.

When I saw him about a year later I was surprised to learn that he had turned the business totally around and was projecting profits that year to be up 100%. When I asked him how he had achieved this he spoke about some of the new people he had hired and some of the structural changes he had made. 'But,' he said, 'I guess the biggest reason is that we doubled our prices.'

Getting  back  to  profitability  may  not  always  be  this  simple,  but sometimes it's a lot less complicated than all the professionals would lead you to believe.

Recently I came across an article on Schlumberger Ltd, the oilwell testing  operation,  which  is  one  of  the  biggest,  best  run  and  most profitable  companies  in  the  world.  Schlumberger  publicizes  to  its customers  that  its  service  is  marked  up  100%.  If  Schlumberger's costs go up, so does their cost to the customer, and not by the same amount,  but  by  double  that  amount.  They  not  only  remember  to make a profit; they are not afraid to make one.

Sometimes the  answer  may  be  that  simple:  charge  more.  Or  at least charge enough so that you are not always losing money.

Many companies, I believe, who are busy buying new businesses and  bringing  in  new  management  teams  haven't  even  tested  the

outside edge of their profitability.

I see this all the time in our business. I see our executives afraid to ask what we are really worth or having trouble asking for expenses in addition to fees. They are simply afraid to test the outside edge of what  someone  might  be  willing  to  pay.  (I  once  had  a  secretary  in London who couldn't even bill what someone was willing to pay. She attended to the business affairs and became very good friends with two  young  British  golf  clients.  She  really  knocked  herself  out  for these  clients,  and  did  a  lot  of  little  extras  for  them,  which  is  good business. But two years later I noticed we had never collected our fees from them. When I asked her about it, she blushed and said she just couldn't bring herself to talk to them about money!)

## The Danger Of The Big Kill

The danger of the 'Big Kill' is to an established business what the danger  of  growing  too  quickly  is  to  a  new  one.  In  theory,  most companies would like to double their profits in a year. However, few could  really  handle  it,  and  most  well-run  companies  wouldn't  even try. One of the ways businesses lose profits is to fall prey to the 'Big Kill  syndrome'.  Big  companies,  burdened  by  large  overheads, commit  to  deals  that  they  know  going  in  are  at  best  break-even propositions. These companies need to learn to say no.

This  is  particularly  true  of  businesses  that  rely  on  government contracts.  In  their  effort  to  win  a  bidding  war  they  will  take  on  a project  which  doubles  their  overhead  and  makes  no  significant contributions to profitability.  Several  years  later  when  the  project  is finished they either go bankrupt or they take on even bigger breakeven propositions.

Corporations will often use their fear of this to justify diversification. However, intelligent diversification requires so many other considerations that I've never felt this to be a valid response.

Who Are You Trying To Impress?

To me, one of the most interesting recent trends in business is the number of publicly held companies - MGM/UA, Avis and Sotheby's come immediately to mind - which have either gone private or have attempted  to  go  private.  I  suspect  many  major  stockholders  are coming to a conclusion I came to many years ago: it may just be too hard to try to run a company and keep the stockholders happy at the same time. That is the reason IMG will never go public.

American  business  decisions  are  often  based  on  winning  a popularity  contest,  on  impressing  certain  people.  And  the  people everyone is trying to impress work on Wall Street.

Impressing Wall Street has become the Great American Corporate Pastime. Long-term gains are sacrificed for short-term benefits. Bad corporate decisions are made because a company would rather look good than be good. Real profit is thrown away in order artificially to pep up the next quarter.

We would all be a lot better off if more companies tried to impress themselves than the people who work at the lower tip of Manhattan.

## Know Your Competition

Several  years  ago  I  was  playing  doubles  in  Geneva,  Switzerland, with Victor Pecci against Björn Borg and his amateur partner, Swiss banking and shipping magnate, Bruce Rappaport. Björn and I were both  at  the  net  only  a  few  feet  away  from  each  other,  when Rappaport hit a soft lob, which I could see was not going to clear my head. Borg was in a defenceless position and, for the briefest of split seconds, I thought it would be unfair to hit the ball directly at him. I did anyway, of course. I smashed the ball right at his midsection and Borg promptly whistled it past my head for a winning point.

Never underestimate your competition. I think a competitive spirit is  essential  to  both  personal  and  corporate  business success. And how  you  stack  up  against  the  competition  is  one  of  the  best yardsticks for measuring that success.

But there is a major difference between competing in business and competing  in  sports.  In  both  cases,  the  idea  is  to  win,  to  beat everyone else. But in business there is no end to the game. There

are  no  insurmountable  leads.  The  competition  always  has  time  to catch up.

Companies with the greatest market share often have a tendency to  'sit  on  a  lead'.  They  will  take  solace  in  their  numbers,  become complacent, and lose their competitive edge. Business competition, I believe, is a constant ongoing active process of domination.

The  better  you  know  your  competition  -  their  strengths,  their weaknesses, their habits, their tactics - the more you will be able to dominate them.

In  any sort of representative business, or in any business where you  are  paid  on  a  percentage  basis,  if  you  aren't  careful  you  can spend  as  much  time  representing  the  also-rans  as  you  can  the superstars.  Many  years  ago,  when  sports  clients  who  were  in  this questionable  category  approached  us,  we  would  refer  them  to  a particular  competitor  whose weaknesses we knew. While we could never be sure which of these players would develop into champions, we were 100% sure this firm would do a poor job representing them, and so once the winners emerged from the pack we could go after them with absolute certainty that we could sign them up.

## Avoid Vertical Diversification

We  have  had  sports  clients  who,  because  of  their  exceptional success in a very narrow field, automatically presume that they can conquer  the  world  in  any  other  field  as  well:  tennis  players  who decide  to  be  exhibition  promoters;  golfers  who  decide  to  be  real estate developers; Olympic champions who decide to be publishers and  run  magazines.  Many  athletes,  once  they  retire,  want  to  run camps  and  schools,  not  recognizing  the  administrative  skills  and specialized expertise this requires.

We generally try to stop them from getting into these areas without first  acquiring  that  necessary  expertise.  But  the  egos  of  leading sports  personalities,  like  the  egos  of  many  successful  business people, will not listen to reason.

A lot of established companies, as they feel the need to grow and expand, begin to diversify vertically rather than horizontally, and buy

companies  that  they  don't  have  any  business  being  in.  At  some level, they know that they lack the expertise, the real understanding of how the business works, but their egos won't let them admit this to themselves.  The  corporate  American  landscape  is  littered  with  the bodies of these egotistical acquisitions.

## Don't Sue The Bastards

Someone told me that last year IBM paid $12 million in legal fees to a single law firm.

I graduated from Yale Law School and practised law with the firm of  Arter  &  Hadden  of  Cleveland,  Ohio,  which  is  Cleveland's  oldest and one of its most prestigious law firms. I am still a partner of the firm, and yet I must say that the entire judicial system of the United States leaves me cold.

Fights  between  law  firms  on  behalf  of  clients  are  often  mere vehicles for firms to charge time and earn money. I feel that if you can  put  the  two  parties  in  most  legal  disputes  in  a  room  by themselves - even two years into the legal dispute - the matter will get  resolved,  certainly  more  cheaply,  and  probably  a  lot  more equitably.

We have  been  fairly  lucky  with  law  suits  in  our  business  in  the sense that we have not had that many. Since so many of us were trained  as  lawyers,  I  think  we  realize  all  the  pitfalls  and  expenses that can be incurred when you start legal proceedings.

In other parts of the world the losers in law suits pay the winner's legal fees in addition to court costs and the judgements. To me this is a far better system. It discourages frivolous law suits and the kneejerk business reaction of 'see you in court'.

The Japanese seem to work things out among themselves better than  anyone.  While  many  people  have  pointed  out  there  are  no business schools in Japan, no one seems to have noticed that there are also very few law firms in Japan.

We were once sued, along with our client Björn Borg, by Lamar Hunt, who has a battery of lawyers working for him. I decided that it was foolish from a business standpoint for Lamar Hunt to be suing

Björn  Borg  when  he  was  trying  at  the  same  time  to  run  the  World Championship  tennis  tour  and  obviously  wanted  Borg  to  play  in some of his tournaments. I therefore went to Dallas and saw Lamar personally.  We  sat  down  in  a  room  together  and  in  one  meeting settled the suit. Had this been left up to the lawyers we would still be in  court,  and  hundreds  and  thousands  of  dollars  would  have  gone down the drain.

## Getting Things Done

If  executives  were  asked to list  their  greatest  frustrations  I  suspect that not having enough time would be very near the top of the list. The constant flow of business provides an equally constant flow of interruptions  which  keep  people  from  spending  their  time  the  way they  had  planned  to.  Something  always  comes  up,  and  they  find themselves  further  behind  at  the  end  of  the  day  than  when  they began.

The solutions to these problems are a lot simpler than people are often  willing  to  admit.  It  is  mostly  a  matter  of  controlling  your business  day  rather  than  having  it  control  you,  of  forcing  activities into  the  time  available,  rather  than  trying  to  expand  the  time  to accommodate the activities.

But many people fear that if they don't seem out of control they aren't going to seem busy enough or important enough. They really don't want to manage their time well.

Once you really believe that controlling your time is not only more productive, but more pleasant, then the rest is fairly easy.

## Time Management

The  one  thing  that  people  who  know  me  best  attribute  to  me  the most is an ability to manage my time efficiently.

I  begin by viewing a week as 168 hours, and I schedule time for relaxation  and  rest  as  well  as  work.  I  force  myself  to  have  time  to relax whether it be to play tennis, read the morning paper, take a nap in the office, or simply to do nothing - to free my mind from any sort of work-oriented thoughts or decisions. To make sure I have this time I  programme these non-work activities into my schedule. If I know,

for  instance,  that  my  first  time  commitment  is  at  7  a.m.,  I  would rather  get  up  at  5  a.m.  and  spend  an  hour  reading,  relaxing  and exercising  than  get  up  at  6  a.m.  and  have  to  rush  to  my  first appointment  without  having  time  to  myself.  My  schedule  that  day would therefore begin at 5 a.m.

I hate leaving unfinished business or having anything hanging over my head, and I work with great intensity to obtain moments of empty space - a minute, an hour or a weekend - in which to enjoy having nothing to do. These moments are the carrots at the end of my stick and by programming them into my schedule, I force myself to finish the business activities leading up to them within the time specifically allocated for them.

This has led to a kind of heightened state of time consciousness. I always perceive any business activity or commitment as a function of the time I have allotted for it. I also play a kind of game with myself. If a meeting is starting in one hour and I have decided there are ten things  I  want  to  accomplish  before  that  meeting  begins,  I  will  do whatever is necessary to fit all ten things into that hour. It may mean making a phone call a lot shorter than I would have liked, or dashing off a note rather than a letter, but by challenging myself this way, by fitting activities into smaller and smaller time segments, I have over the years developed an almost minute-by-minute awareness of how I am spending my time.

I  know  how  long  it  takes  me  to  do  everything,  and  I  know  the quickest  way  to  do  everything,  from  how  fast  or  slow  certain restaurants  are  and  in  which  ones  you  therefore  have  to  order immediately,  to  the  fastest  elevators  in  certain  buildings.  When arriving at airports, for instance, I will often have people meet me at the departure ramp, which is almost never as crowded as the arrival area and therefore much quicker.

In short, I try to be very precise about everything that by its nature is  imprecise.  My  mind  is  a  catalogue  of  'quick  cuts'  to  reduce  the time-wasting  vagueness  of  certain  activities  or  to  avoid  them altogether.

When travelling internationally, for instance, I know which carriers, such as Qantas to Australia and Cathay Pacific to Asia, put priority tags on first-class luggage. I know that Concorde baggage clearance

is quick, that early morning arrivals in London for Americans and in Honolulu from Asia and Australia are disasters, and that international arrivals  into  Los  Angeles  are  disasters  at  almost  any  time.  I  have found that I am even something of an expert on traffic flow and rush hours in the major cities of the world.

It  is  simply  a  matter  of  using  this  information  to  my  time-saving advantage,  or  making  certain  pre-arrangements  based  on  this information. For instance, I usually travel light and carry everything on board. But to do this constantly I maintain a complete wardrobe in each of my five principal residences and a partial wardrobe at those offices where I don't have a separate residence. And if I know I will need something in Paris I will send it directly there, rather than carry it with me first to New York and then to London.

I have used some international travel examples here because they are  so  'unmanageable'  by  nature.  But  I  try  to  take  this  same approach to every aspect of my business. By knowing how long it will take me to do something and by knowing the quickest way to get it  done,  I  can  take  control  over  things  that  may  not  seem  all  that controllable.

As  a  general  rule  for  getting  things  done  the  quickest, do  the things that everyone else has to do at the times when everyone else isn't doing them. I leave so early in the morning that getting to work is never a problem. But I've heard others complain about rush-hour traffic  then  admit  that  if  they'd  left  twenty  minutes  earlier  it  could have been avoided. The answer seems so obvious, and yet so many people have difficulty making a simple twenty-minute adjustment in their  schedule.  They'd  rather  be  miserable  for  an  hour  on  the freeway.

I've  seen  employees  get  a  pay  cheque  on  Friday,  try  to  cash  it between 12 a.m. and 3 p.m. that afternoon, then complain because the lines were so long! I have also seen some of our own executives who are flying out of New York schedule a departure time that will compete with everyone else who is trying to get home. Ninety per cent  of  wasting  time  and  standing  in  line  can  be  eliminated  with  a little pre-planning and some common sense.

## An Organization System

The whole solution to mastering time is to do the things you planned on doing when you planned on doing them, and for no longer than you planned on doing them. This demands that you work from some overall organizational system.

I  operate  both  my  life  and  my  time  from  a  series  of  yellow  legal pads, with one sheet devoted to each day and a vertical line drawn down the middle. Things to do go on the right side of the vertical line, people to call go on the left side. I keep this pad in about fifty-day segments,  and  at  the  end  I  have  several  pages  for  calls  and activities  which  are  not  going  to  be  done  during  this  fifty-day  time frame but at some point in the future.

When I ask someone when he would like me to call and he says next Wednesday at about 10:30, I will put that person's name and phone number about a third of the way down the left-hand side of the page marked for next Wednesday. Late afternoon and evening calls and activities occupy the bottom third of the page and early morning activities  the  top  third  of  the  page.  I  review  this  pad  periodically during  the  day  to  see  how  I  am  doing.  If  I'm  getting  behind  I  will rarely eliminate anything but I will pick up the pace.

I also keep a separate pad with pages marked for different parts of the world. If someone says to me, 'Get in touch with so-and-so when you're in  Melbourne,' or if  something comes up that I must handle personally in Tokyo, I will make a note on the relevant page.

In addition to my yellow pads, I always have a stack of 3 × 5 cards in  any  coat  pocket.  Some  of  them  are  marked  with  the  names  of employees  or  business  associates  with  whom  I  am  in  regular contact. If I think of something in relation to one of these people I will jot  it  down  on  the  appropriate  card.  The  next  time  I  speak  to  that person I will have everything I want to talk about at my fingertips.

I also carry a stack of blank cards that I fill up with miscellaneous notes  during  the  day,  and  at  the  end  of  the  day  I  transfer  that information to the appropriate page of the appropriate yellow pad.

I  write  down  everything  I  intend  to  do  and  once  I  have  written  it down I forget about it. I know it will turn up at the appropriate time and place on the appropriate day.

Obviously, how you choose to organize your work life is the most personal of all aspects of time management. I know people who use a pocket calendar and a notebook the same way I use yellow pads and  note  cards.  I  have  worked  with  people  who  seldom  organize more than one week in advance. And I have seen people work quite efficiently simply from a 'to-do' list unrelated to time itself.

Yet  I  have  never  known  a  successful  person  in  business  who didn't operate from some personal organizational system.

There are two points about the way I organize myself which have an almost universal application.

First, write  it  down. Write  it  down  anywhere,  shirt-sleeves  if necessary, but write it down. This allows you to free your mind for other  things.  But  more  important, it  means  you  are  going  to  do  it. Writing something down is a commitment. Once you have performed this  physical  act  you  have  provided  the  momentum  for  getting something done. The agony of carrying over an item and the ecstasy that comes with crossing it off will provide further incentive.

Second, organize for the next day at the end of the previous day. This is what gives me peace of mind at night, a feeling that I am on top of things, and a real excitement about coming into work the next morning. Simply by arranging the next day - defining on paper what I want to accomplish - I feel that I have a head start.

I  do  the  same  thing  periodically  over  longer  time  spans:  weekly, monthly, bi-monthly, semi-annually, annually and bi-annually, on up to some general things I want to accomplish over the next five years.

## Stick To Your Schedule

Once you have made an itinerary or schedule it is worthless if you don't stick to it.

A large part of sticking to your schedule is an awareness that it is very rare that something is so important or a crisis is so imminent that  it  has  to  be  attended  to  immediately.  Treat  interruptions  or anything  else  that  just  comes  up  as  you  would  any  other  time commitment.  Don't  respond  immediately  but  programme  time  for dealing  with  these  situations  into  your  future  schedule  -  that

afternoon, tomorrow or next week - whenever you have a space to fit them in or can make a space to fit them in.

The other major aspect of sticking to your schedule is allocating the appropriate amount of time to the activities that will be filling it up.

It  is  probably worse to allocate too little time than it is to allocate too much. This puts you in a position of always having to catch up, which backs up through your schedule and usually gets worse as the day wears on.

I think most people can predict with reasonable accuracy how long their  usual  business  activities  will  take  them,  but  they  will  often deceive themselves.

To manage time well you have to believe in your own knowledge. If  you  know  a  weekly  meeting  takes  thirty  minutes,  don't  convince yourself  that  today  it  will  only  take  fifteen  minutes  simply  because today  you  have  more  to  do.  If  you  have  to  be  somewhere  in  ten minutes and you have ten minutes to get there, don't make one more phone call simply because you want to get it out of the way. People who manage their time badly seem to want to be unrealistic and go out of their way to create out-of-control situations.

## Allocate Personalities

Since  most  of  the  business  day  is  spent  dealing  with  people  you have to factor in their styles and personalities when budgeting your time.  I  have  certain  people  working  for  me  with  whom  I  can  cover twenty-five subjects in a fifteen-minute phone call. I have others with whom that would take all week, who have a need to make even the simplest statements the beginning of a drawn-out dialogue. This is the nature of certain people and I'm not going to be able to change it. It's  much  wiser  simply  to  budget  more  time  for  them  or  to  discuss fewer subjects.

You should obviously have a pretty good idea of the number and complexity of the subjects to be discussed before meeting anyone, but how long each will take also depends on two human factors: how quickly the other person gets the point and/or gets to the point, and his or her personal style of doing business.

When  dealing  with  Bob  Anderson,  Chairman  of  Rockwell,  for instance, I know he will usually get to the point before I even finish my sentence. I also know that if I finish the sentence anyway just for the sake of finishing it, this will be a waste of his time.

On the other hand I have had several lunch meetings with Roone Arledge, the exceptionally capable head of the ABC Network's news and sports division, whose style of doing business is totally different. We  have  had  several  lunches  which  meandered  on  through  the afternoon.  On  one  occasion  the  restaurant's  dinner  patrons  began arriving while we were still having brandy and coffee.

This is Roone Arledge's style, which is very effective for him, and therefore when I am dealing with him, the most effective for me. I will simply  allocate  the  appropriate  amount  of  time  for  lunch  on  those particular  days.  Rather  than  make  myself  anxious  by  scheduling  a host of other afternoon commitments, I will most likely leave the rest of the day blank.

Learn everything about the people you are dealing with, including the  way  they  like  to  do  business  and  their  own  time  management habits.  I  know  the  people  who  will  invariably  be  twenty  or  thirty minutes  late  for  a  meeting  and  I  will  play  on  that.  I  will  allocate meetings with them at a later time on my schedule than they have on theirs and  use  the  time  differential to get several things accomplished.  This  is  much  more  productive  than  getting  irritated and hoping that they show up on time for a change.

## Phone Calls

Phone calls and meetings take up most of my day and, I imagine, the  better  part  of  most  executives'  days.  If  you  can  get  these  two business activities under control everything else will fall in place.

I  seldom accept any phone call. I would rather deal with it in my own time and when I can focus my attention on the call rather than on what it is interrupting. Initiating a phone call also gives me more control and time to plan what I want to say.

But I return every phone call, with two exceptions: if I simply don't want to talk to the caller or if the call is better handled by someone

else  in  our  organization  (in  which  case  I  make  sure  that  the appropriate person gets back to the caller).

Returning every phone call is more a matter of personal style than of  time  management  but  it  works  for  me  because  I  don't  have  to spend a lot of time keeping track of who I haven't called or feeling guilty about it.

## PAUSE TO ANTICIPATE

I wasn't even aware that I did this but someone pointed it out to me. Whenever my secretary buzzes to tell me the other party is on the line, I will put my hand on the receiver and pause a moment before actually picking it up. What I am doing is taking a few final seconds to anticipate: what do I want to accomplish and what's the quickest way to accomplish it?

I heard this line once: 'If you don't know where you're going you'll end up somewhere else.' There's probably no greater truism about talking  on  the  phone.  If  you're  not  crystal  clear  in  your  own  mind what  you  want  to  accomplish,  you  probably  won't  end  up accomplishing it.

## GET TO THE POINT

Though I am pretty good at allocating my time in order to stick to my schedule, I still often find myself forcing the end of phone calls.

I am a great believer that it is not difficult to get to the point or to end  a  phone  call  quickly,  and  yet  I  see  many  people  who  have trouble  doing  this.  Typically  people  on  the  telephone  will  take  five times longer than necessary to say what has to be said. They equate ending a telephone call with being impolite or insensitive.

If I want to end a call and I know the person well, I will just tell him that I have to go or that I will get back to him later. If I don't know him well  I  might  say  something  like  'There  are  three  or  four  people waiting outside for a meeting which should have started five minutes ago' or 'I have got a call coming in from Switzerland on the other line that I have been trying to get all day.'

I also like to get to the point of the phone call first, then engage in any small talk as time may allow. Most people do the opposite. They will chat for five minutes before getting around to the purpose of their

call. Sometimes this may be appropriate but far more often than not, in addition to wasting your own time, you may be wasting the time of the person you called. Even worse, he may have to take another call and you will hang up without having said the one thing you called to say.

Finally, I can pretty well estimate how long it will take me to make all my phone calls on a particular day. If I have promised to return a call at a specific time I will make that call very close to when I said I would. For all remaining calls I will allocate a time period - usually thirty to ninety minutes - and set that time aside.

I will then list the phone calls in the order I want to make them and I will put at the end those calls which I can easily shorten, if pressed for  time.  Listing  calls  in  this  manner  -  by  the  latitude  I  have  for shortening them - almost always allows me to stick to my allocated time frame.

This also means that I usually save most of my staff and internal calls for last, when, if necessary, I can be more abrupt.

## HOW TO SHORTEN THE LONG MAYBE

Every  phone  call  should  accomplish  something.  If  you  can't  get  a definite response out of someone, get the outside date when he will have one. If you can't get this out of him either, get the outside date when he will be able to give you an outside date. If you can't even get this, forget it. Any further pursuit is almost certainly going to be a waste  of  your  time,  and  just  in  knowing  this  you've  already accomplished a great deal.

## HOW TO AVOID PHONE TAG

Sometimes the most you can accomplish is to find out when you will actually be able to speak to the other party. A lot of people waste a lot of time going back and forth just trying to reach one another.

It  should rarely take more than two phone calls to reach anyone, as  long  as  you  initiate  both  calls.  When  you  can't  reach  the  other party the first time don't ask him or her to return your call. Find out when he will be available then volunteer to call back again.

I have often asked the secretary of the person I am trying to reach when  that  person  might  be  able  to  return  my  call.  Once  I  have

extracted a specific date and time I will then say that I will call back at that time. If you can't get this kind of information, establish a very narrow time-window for calling again: 'Please tell Mr Soand-So that I will  try  to  reach  him  this  afternoon between 2:45 and 3 p.m.' Once it's  there  in  black  and  white  people  will  schedule  commitments around your call just so they will be available.

If  it  takes  more  than  two  phone  calls  to  reach  someone,  it  is probably not a logistical problem. It is more likely a case of the other person not wanting to talk to you.

## HOW TO MAKE THEM TAKE YOUR CALL

Tell  them  something  they  want  to  hear  or  something  they  will  be afraid not to hear.

I  once  received  a  call  from  someone  I  didn't  know  and  the message was, 'I've got some great news.' It turned out to be one of those telephone solicitations but at least I did return the call.

Recently I called the chairman of a major airline, whom I did not know very well, about a sports promotion we were packaging. Since I know none of the airlines has any money these days and since we can always use airline travel credits, I said to his secretary, 'Please tell Mr -- that I have an idea I'd like to discuss with him, and if he really likes it, it won't cost him any money.' He took the call.

If  you  and  the  other  party  have  a  mutual  acquaintance, and you know  their  relationship  is  a  good  one, the  use  of  this  name  will almost always get you through. If the call is really important you can make an acquaintance just for  that  purpose.  I  have  known  people who,  when  trying  to  reach  a  specific  individual  within  another company, will first call the company's president and confirm with his secretary  that  this  individual  is  indeed  the  person  to  whom  they should be speaking. When they make the call they begin by saying that Mr So-and-So's office suggested that they should be talking to this particular person.

## SILENCE MEANS CONSENT

A phone call doesn't have to be a two-way communication. If you are just  imparting  information,  rather  than  exchanging  or  discussing  it,

leave a detailed message and don't call back. If the party has any questions he'll get back to you.

If  you  are  calling  for  a  simple  answer  to  a  question,  to  confirm something, or to get the other party's support or agreement, couch the call in such a way that silence means consent. 'Please have Mr So-and-So call me back only if he disagrees.'

I have known some very effective salesmen who use this to set up appointments and who get in to see people they don't even know or who otherwise wouldn't see them: 'Write on Mr So-and-So's calendar that I  will  stop  by  at  10:30  next  Wednesday. If this is inconvenient, please have him call me.'

## WHO GETS ON FIRST?

Some  executives  are  really  hung  up  over  power  protocol  when  it comes  to  talking  on  the  phone.  They  refuse  to  punch  the  buttons themselves and spend a lot of time making sure they are never on the  phone  first.  Again,  you  have  to  know  the  personalities  of  the people with whom you are dealing.

I  know  the  people  who  think  that  I  am  trying  to  one-up  them  in some way if I am not already on the phone when they pick up. When I call these people I always make sure I'm on the phone first.

I  know  the  people  who  resent  having  their  secretaries  take information  for  them  or  who  always  prefer  to  set  up  their  own appointments. And I know the people who like to answer the phone themselves, and I make sure I always deal with these people myself. I know the people I can interrupt and the people who would find this the ultimate business insult.

There are some executives who think that secretaries should only talk  to  other  secretaries  and would find it distressing if I personally set up an appointment through their secretary rather than having one of my secretaries do it for me.

Know  the  characters  of  the  people  you  are  dealing  with  and observe  their  phone  protocol,  not  your  own  -  even  if  theirs  is sometimes a bit silly.

## Internal Meetings

Staff and internal meetings are the bane of corporate life. They are essential to communication and decision making, yet most of them go nowhere, accomplish nothing and waste everyone's time. Since they can't be eliminated, minimize their number, their frequency and their length.

## WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE AND WHAT ARE THEY DOING IN MY MEETING?

Rule:  a  meeting's  productivity  is  inversely  proportionate  to  the number  of  people  attending  it.  First  Corollary:  beyond  four  or  five attendees,  productivity  decreases  exponentially.  Second  Corollary: the longer a meeting has been in existence, the bigger it becomes.

The  vast  majority  of  internal  meetings  are  attended  by  more people than need to be there. This can be attributed to two realities of corporate life.

First,  every  company  has  its  quota  of  executives  who  judge  the value  of  what  they  have  to  say  by  the  number  of  people  who  are forced to listen to them. For these executives an important meeting is one in which there aren't enough chairs to go around.

Second,  there  is  the  'left-out  factor'.  Meetings  have  a  way  of becoming part  of  the  corporate  merit  system,  and  people  begin  to judge their importance to the company by the number and nature of the meetings they are asked to attend. Assign a meeting a regular time slot or give it a name, and this guarantees that the left-out factor will become even greater.

We once had a small informal committee which met infrequently and irregularly for the purpose of making decisions in a very narrow area. But over the years both its size and purpose grew until it was no  longer  conducive  to  decision  making  and  became  strictly informational.  Still,  everyone  wanted  to  attend.  Finally,  I  took  the position that this committee should meet once a year, that everyone who wanted to could attend, and that its purpose would no longer be decision making or informational, but strictly to make everyone feel good. That lent some perspective and we were able to go back once again to a small gathering.

Meetings, like corporate policies,  should  be  reviewed  regularly  for their frequency, their necessity and their size. People who might otherwise  wish  to  attend  may  be  just  as  content  to  receive  the

minutes. Others might actually be pleased not to  attend  and  would like nothing better than to have their time back for more productive purposes.

I  have  occasionally  set  arbitrary  guidelines  to  determine  who qualifies  to  attend  our  most  'popular'  meetings  -  the  guidelines determined by whom I did and did not want to be there. What this may lack in fairness is more than made up for in lack of argument.

## FOLD IN MEETINGS

Both  the  frequency  and  purposes  of  most  regularly  scheduled meetings can be significantly altered without any loss of effectiveness.

The  start-up  time  alone  of  meetings  -  the  time  it  takes  for everyone to show up, get settled in and get rolling - is a big drain on corporate man hours. Very often a one-hour monthly meeting can be more  productive  than  two  forty-five-minute  bi-weekly  ones.  Any meeting that is held more than once a month should be scrutinized very carefully.

Many meetings have parallel or overlapping functions which can easily be folded into one another or combined.

The  irony  of  meetings  is  that  they  follow  a  reverse  Parkinson's Law:  the  number  of  subjects  to  be  discussed  contract  to accommodate  the  time  available.  Meetings  that  are  folded  in  or combined in their purpose or frequency are far more productive.

While meetings are essential to the decision-making process, they are not the best forum for decision making, and if more than four or five  people  are  in  attendance,  decision  making  is  probably  next  to impossible.

Decision making by committee is neither efficient or effective and the  decisions  that  result  are  usually  not  the  best  ones.  It  is  also difficult  to  cede accountability to a committee. Further, the quickest way for a meeting to get out of hand is to announce that a decision must be reached before it ends.

Meetings which are more than just informational should be used to let  people  air  their  views  -  to help the  ultimate  decision  maker decide.  But  it  is  best  for  the  decision  itself  to  come  later.  This

eliminates  further  discussion,  minimizes  confrontation,  discourages public influence-peddling and lends clarity to the decision itself.

## HOW TO RUN A MEETING

The time a meeting is to begin and the time it is to end should  be established  as  early  as  possible,  committed  to  paper  (thus encouraging punctuality) and distributed by name to every attendee. Meetings that begin at an odd time - 10:15 as opposed to 10:30 are also generally attended with greater punctuality.

If  several  subjects  are  to  be  discussed,  an  agenda  should  be distributed and/or given to each person as he or she arrives. This is less  to  inform  than  to  move  the  meeting  along.  If  everyone  knows when the meeting is to end and can see the number of subjects still to be covered, it will be easier to cut off discussion on one subject and move on to the next.

If  I  am  chairing  I  will  generally  place  the  shorter  informational subjects at the beginning of a meeting and save the longer subjects or discussion points for the end.

On  these  longer,  more  discussion-oriented  subjects  I  will  first summarize  the  topic  and  all  the  sides  to  the  issue,  in  order  to eliminate a lot of back-and-forth.

## MEET IN HALLWAYS

I would like to find the guy who first said, 'There is no such thing as a stupid  question,'  and  force  him  to  sit  through  the  monthly  meeting cycle of any major corporation. A 'stupid question' is any that could be asked just as easily before or after the meeting and enlightens no one but the person asking it.

I  would  venture  that  half  the  scheduled  meetings  in  the  average American  company  could  be  done  away  with  entirely  and  never missed.  Scheduling  a  meeting  is  often  the  automatic  response  to dealing with those subjects which are slightly too complex to handle internally over the telephone. 'Meeting in hallways' - i.e., any short informal gathering of three or four people to exchange information or to get a quick consensus - is a better, more efficient alternative.

People will also be less upset about not being 'invited'.

## External Meetings

One obviously has greater control and more authority over the length of  an  internal  meeting  than  over  an  external  one  Yet  even  when meeting with someone outside the company - at his office or mine I  have  become fairly  adept  at  forcing  the  meeting's  length  into  the time I have allocated for it.

To do this successfully one must establish immediately and as the first  order  of  business  -  either  by  setting  the  agenda or by coming right out and saying it - the amount of time one has available. Most people will appreciate this. It gives them a better idea of how much time they should allocate to each subject.

Again,  I  contend  that  the  initial  moments  of  a  meeting  -  from exchanging greetings to getting down to business - are more crucial to its content and critical to its outcome than anything that is likely to follow.  I  use  this  time  to  set  the  agenda,  the  tone,  the  atmosphere and to make certain desired impressions. For this reason I eliminate all extraneous activity from the beginning of a meeting. I will not have anyone shown into my office until I am off the phone or have finished shuffling papers and can devote my total attention to the person I am meeting.  I  will  rarely  allow  any  phone  call  or  business  matter  to interrupt the flow of these initial moments. I will get coffee or drink orders out of the way, and served , before commencing any business dialogue.  If  I  can  control  these  first  few  minutes  I  will  not  only determine the meeting's length but almost everything else about it as well.

If it's time to end a meeting and the other person doesn't seem to want to, there are all sorts of things you can say or body language you can use. (On occasion, I've even picked up the phone receiver and cradled it in my hand.) You just have to be willing to say or use them.

Many times a meeting between two parties who don't know each other very well will drag on and on because each is waiting for the other to end it. The slightest hint will usually bring these meetings to a conclusion.

Of  course,  one  must  also  recognize  (as  in  the  case  of  a  Roone Arledge) the people for whom any appearance of concern with time can work against your main purposes. Most of our executives prefer to move quickly, to jump from deal to deal, to leap into a problem or a situation, solve it or get it done and move on to the next one. It is absolutely essential to know who, among the people you deal with, is rubbed the wrong way by this hyper-active approach.

Generally  speaking  the  Japanese  consider  the  desire  to  end  a meeting shortly after it begins a breach of etiquette and a break with their  own  customs  and  culture.  If  you  try  to  get  from  A  to  B  too quickly, you may not get there at all.

In our business the same thing is true in dealing with the heads of sports  federations.  These  are  usually  unpaid  positions  and  the people who take them on do so not because they must but because they want to: it is their hobby. When you try to make a meeting with them as short as possible or force them to the point rather than let them talk around, over and under it, you are often cutting your own throat.

I  once  dealt  with  a  British  sports  official  who  was  so  slow  to  do anything  he  probably,  in  the  words  of  our  business  associate, 'screwed  his  shoes  on  in  the  morning'.  We  would  have  lunch together and it would often take me literally three hours to get him on to the first point.

He also never wanted a meeting to end, and I finally  got  to  the point  where  when  I  wanted  to  indicate  that  I  had  to  leave  I  would take off my watch and put it on the table in front of us. Yet he was so oblivious  to  the  time  concerns  of  others  I  was  sure  he  didn't  even notice.  But  he  did.  One  day  he  mentioned  to  our  mutual  business associate  this  peculiar  habit  I  had  of  removing  my  watch  during lunch, and wondered if I hadn't lost a lot of watches that way.

## RESTAURANT MEETINGS

Breakfast,  lunch  and  dinner  meetings  are  an  important  part  of  my business day for, as I said, I prefer them to office meetings: they are automatically more intimate, friendly and less formal; they are more revealing about the person; and the other person is more vulnerable and receptive.

I take great care to assure that the atmosphere of these meetings is  not  only  relaxed  but  conducive to business. First, and for all the reasons mentioned above, I seldom have restaurant meetings with more than one person. (With two or more guests, the psychological dynamics  become  more  variable  and  therefore  more  difficult  to interpret or control.)

Second, particularly in New York, Paris and London where one is often seated nearer to the person at the next table than to the person one is meeting, I never make reservations for less than three. This at least gets me out of sardine row.

Third, I will not turn to business until the meal has been ordered and the menus taken away. Since I believe the first minute or two are so  important  in  establishing  everything  that  is  to  follow  I  find  it disconcerting  to  have  a  waiter  hovering  over  or  around  the  table while I am trying to make my initial points.

Finally,  while  I  have  never  been  driven  by  the  need  to  dine  at 'power' restaurants (in fact, I often question the real power of those who must), I do believe in frequenting those which understand the business dining atmosphere: restaurants which take as much pain to assure  peace,  quiet  and  tranquillity  as  they  do  in  preparing  their specials of the day.

## Know Your Own Work Habits

I  have  learned  over  the  years  how  to  arrange  my  schedule  to accommodate my work habits. The early morning is my best time for thinking  and  for  making  phone  calls  to  the  different  parts  of  the world, where business days have already begun. I will usually get up two  to  three  hours  before  my  first  actual  time  commitment  to  do everything  from  push-ups  to  business  reading  to  overseas  phone calls. I also tend to have a lot of early morning meetings. Most of our staff meetings start at 7 a.m. or 7:30 and more often than not I will have  two  breakfast  meetings  before  arriving  at  the  office.  My  first office activity of the day is almost always dictation, when my mind is clearest.

By noon I usually have a pretty good leg up on the day and my afternoons are slightly less frenetic. I will save those appointments and  activities  for  last  which  are  most  likely  to  be  open-ended  or where  I  can  be  the  most  relaxed.  About  half  my  evenings  involve some business-related activity. The others are set aside as rewards. I  will  also  use  travel  time  for  rest  and  relaxation  as  much  as  for getting from one place to the next.

I have found that most people function better in the earlier part of the day and seem to drag a bit right after lunch. But I'm sure there are others who are just the opposite, who gain momentum and pick up  speed  as  the  day  goes  on.  What's  important  is  that  you  know your own time clock and plan your day accordingly.

Once you have organized your work day in a way that is best for you, stick to it. I will, for instance, occasionally dictate in a limousine on  the  way  to  the  airport  but  otherwise  I  dictate  in  the  morning, period.  In  over  twenty  years  I  can  count  on  my  fingers  the  times when a letter or memo was so important it couldn't wait until the next morning.

For me, getting the most out of my abilities is directly proportionate to  getting  the  most  out  of  my  time.  I  take  an  aggressive  attitude towards time and I seek to control it rather than have it control me.

Nevertheless, one of the very simple realities of effective personal time management may be that the forty-hour work week is only for unions. I've  never  met a successful businessman who didn't put in considerably more than forty hours a week. In fact, the people I know who spend the most hours are also the people who make the best use of these hours. The two often seem to go hand-in-hand.

By organizing myself in a way that fits my personal work habits, by planning out my leisure time as well as my work time and by writing everything down, I am able to free my mind totally from work-related thoughts  when  I  am  not  working  and  focus  totally  on  work  when  I am. This allows me not to carry my problems to bed with me at night. I sleep like a log.

Learn To Say No Even When It Hurts

The best instant time saver I know of is to say no. People have a hard time doing this even when it is the obvious response. They are afraid they may offend someone, they may be hedging their bets or they simply don't want to make a decision at that particular moment.

It  is  very  easy  to  say  no  without  being  impolite.  A  no  expressed with reluctance or regret, or with a believable excuse ('If I wasn't so pressed for time …', 'If I had known about this six months ago …', etc.) can be just as final and definitive as 'I'm not interested.'

The bigger problem is a reluctance to be final, a feeling that there is  a  chance,  however  remote,  that  one  may  be  missing  an opportunity.  There  have  been  many  occasions  where I  have  found myself  in  this  situation,  and  I  have  forced  myself  to  say  no  even when it hurt.

Just recently we were approached about packaging a major sports event  which  was  already  financed.  Even  though  I  knew  we  could probably make it work, I felt the cost in time and manpower was too great,  and  declined.  Every  opportunity  has  to  be  considered  in  the context  of  other  commitments,  and  occasionally  you  are  going  to miss out on one. But if you try to sniff out every opportunity until you are  100%  certain  one  way  or  the  other,  you  may  find  yourself bringing an entire company to its knees.

By far the biggest problem people have with saying no is that they convince  themselves  that  by  buying  time  they  are  actually  saving time. If you are feeling overwhelmed or harassed, it is much easier to say 'Let me think about it' or 'Let me get back to you' than it is to deal  with  it  and  get  it  out  of  the  way.  This  is  particularly  tempting when you already know the answer is going to be a negative one.

Obviously, these situations don't just go away, and by not taking five  minutes  to  deal  with  it  at  the  moment  you  invariably  end  up spending a lot more time with it in the future.

I  have  been  on  the  receiving  end  of  many  'no's  and  I  actually prefer an instant negative response to an excessively long-drawn-out maybe. Usually these end up wasting my time and come to the same conclusion anyway.

A 'no' is often better for everyone. It saves time on both sides, and it will give you a sense of satisfaction. The realization that you won't

have  to  deal  with  it  again  can  make  you  feel  like  you've  really accomplished something.

## Decision Making

Someone  once  told  me  that,  when  the  Ford  Motor  Company interviews  a  managerial-level  applicant,  they  note  whether  the potential employee puts salt and pepper on his food before he tastes it,  the  theory  being  that  such  a  person  is  likely  to  make  a  decision before knowing all the facts.

I hope this isn't true, first because I don't think it has anything to do with decision making - I know some excellent decision makers who happen to like their food very spicy - and second, because one of the biggest problems people have with decision making is a desire to know too many facts, their theory being that if you have enough facts the decision will make itself.

The people I respect the most in business are all instant decision makers. They don't need to know every 'knowable' fact first.  They accept that they are going to make their share of wrong decisions and  are  confident  enough  in  themselves  to  know  that  most  of  the time they are going to make the right one.

When  someone  is  reputed  to  be  a  good  decision  maker,  that judgement is usually based as much on how quickly and definitely he decides as it is on the results.

## THE SEAT-OF-THE-PANTS FACTOR

Some companies, asked the simplest question, always respond with the same non-answer: 'I think we've got some data on that.'

Decision  making  is  more  an  intuitive  process  than  an  analytical one, and no amount of market studies, focus groups and research reports is going to change that fact. The danger is that the more data people have to chew upon, the more likely they are to underestimate the importance of intuition - the seat-of-the-pants factor.

In  sales,  as  previously  noted,  good  or  correct  timing  is  often  a matter  of  converting  sensory  perception  into  conscious  action. Decision  making  is  exactly  the  same  process,  only  the  flow  is

reversed. It is taking analytical data, facts and figures and converting them into sensory perceptions. If you eliminate the need to 'feel' a decision,  you  won't  make  very  good  decisions  or  you  won't  make them at all.

I  once  heard  a  story  of  a  Columbia  University  scientist  who  had received  a  grant  to  study  how  sound  vibrations  might  be  used  to exterminate  insects.  In  one  experiment,  he  trained  a  cockroach  to leap over a pencil at the command of 'Jump!' But during the course of the experiment the cockroach became trapped in a drawer and, in an effort to extricate itself, lost some of its legs.

The  scientist  noted  that,  after  the  accident,  whenever  he  yelled 'Jump!' the cockroach just sat there. In a report on his findings, he concluded that, 'The cockroach was so traumatized by the loss of its legs it went deaf.'

Facts are a decision maker's tools, but 1) they won't take the place of intuition; 2) they won't make the decision for you; and 3) they are only as useful as your ability to interpret them.

Some people ignore the facts altogether ('Don't clutter up my mind with a bunch of details') but a far greater number use them to justify convenient or already established positions rather than the one the facts support. It is obviously difficult to make good decisions based on self-assuring, self-justifying or self-serving bad conclusions.

## LOOK AROUND THE FRINGES

The  best  use  of  facts  -  marketing  data,  surveys,  reports,  what people are telling you - is not their literal interpretation but what they may indicate. A stop sign tells you to 'Stop' but what it indicates is conflicting traffic patterns and certain consequences if you ignore it.

Look around the fringes. What do the facts indicate about trends, biases, conflicts, opportunities?

One kind of decision maker will say, 'We shouldn't do this because three other people tried it and failed,' but a good decision maker will find  out  what  all  three  did  similarly  and  what  all  three  failed  to  do similarly before reaching the same conclusion.

LOOK BEYOND THE FRINGES

The  most  useful  decision-making  information  may  lie  beyond  the facts. Don't be bound only by what you already know.

As successful as we have been in establishing an income base for our sports clients after they retire, there is an inevitable drop-off in income once they are no longer competing actively. Realistically, this hurts us corporately more than it does the athlete personally. A Björn Borg, for instance, who decides to retire, can still live as nicely on $1 million  and  royalties  as  he  can  on  the  $5  million  he  was  making annually as an active tennis professional. But as a company which maintains  a  steady  overhead,  the  loss  of  80%  of  our  commission income can be significant. It puts a constant pressure on us always to be looking for 'the next Borg', even when one isn't out there.

In  grappling  with  this  problem  several  years  ago  I  came  to  the conclusion my mind was no longer constricted by the obvious facts, had to  be  factored  in  just  like  anything  else.  But  in  coming  to  this conclusion my mind was no longer constricted by the obvious facts, and a totally different solution, outside the facts, occurred to me. The answer  was  to  represent  a  mix  of  both  sports  personalities  and sports entities. That led to the creation and licensing of a Wimbledon logo, one of our most successful licensing programmes to date and certainly  one  of  the  steadiest.  Wimbledon  does  not  have  to  win tournaments to maintain visibility, and it won't retire. It has given us a steady  predictable  source  of  income  to  balance  the  more  volatile areas of athlete representation.

Sound corporate decision making is a constant process of staying current, of perceiving how new information can alter old decisions, of anticipating the future.

## ELEPHANTINE DECISION MAKING

A circus keeps a baby elephant from running away by chaining it to a stake. When the animal pulls at the chain, the cuff chafes its leg, and the baby elephant concludes that to avoid pain it had best stay put.

But  when  the  elephant  grows  up  the  circus  still  chains  it  to  the same small stake. The mature elephant could now pull the stake out of the ground like a toothpick, but the elephant remembers the pain, and is  too  dumb  to  use  the  new  set  of  facts  -  how  circumstances

have changed. The tiny stake keeps a two-ton elephant at bay just as effectively as it did the baby.

Many  executives  are  too  dependent  on  old  facts,  outmoded conventions,  or  are  still  basing  decisions  on  what  worked  twenty years ago. This is elephantine decision making.

## GO WITH FIRST IMPRESSIONS, BUT …

I almost always go with first impressions, but I let them settle in for a period of time. Decisions are - and should be - partly emotional, but it is helpful to keep your options open until the cold harsh light of day has  had  a  chance  to  shine  on  them:  are  there  any  obvious considerations that haven't been considered? If none occurs to me in the first twenty-four hours, this means they will probably never occur to me - or that by the time they do it will be too late anyway.

## GOOD DECISIONS ARE SELF-FULFILLING

If you immediately start to second guess a decision you have made it will  most  likely  prove  a  bad  one,  not  because  it  was  the  wrong decision, but because you undermined its chance for success.

A lot of questionable decisions have worked, because the people who made them were determined to make them work, and a lot of good  decisions  have  failed,  because  the  people  who  made  them never got over their doubts.

When  I  first  decided  we  were  going  to  create  and  market  a Wimbledon  logo  I  met  all  sorts  of  resistance  from  people  in  our company who would be involved in the effort. First, Wimbledon had been around for almost a century, and if this was such a good idea why  hadn't  someone  else  done  it?  Second,  there  was  much evidence  to  support  that  people  would  identify  with  a  Borg  or  a Palmer  or  a  fashion  designer,  but  none  that  they  would  wear  the name  of  a  tennis  tournament  on  their  shirt.  Finally,  and  most damagingly,  we  were  starting  in  the  hole.  Over  twenty-five companies  world-wide  were  already  using  the  name  'Wimbledon' generically  on  their  products.  Our  legal  department  doubted  we could even clean up the market, much less create one.

But  I  believed  that  a  Wimbledon  logo  should  work,  and  that  we were the ones to make it work. If I had been less convinced of this,

or had simply been looking for signs to tell me I was wrong, I'm sure 'Wimbledon'  would  have  remained  a  generic  name,  available  to anyone who cared to use it.

## Office Communication

I  believe that how quickly things get done in an office, how quickly information  gets  exchanged,  is  more  a  matter  of  style  than  of systems.

As I have said, I prefer quick informal exchanges of information to the  more  formal,  and  hence  more  time  consuming,  atmosphere  of meetings. I  prefer  visiting  other  people's  offices  rather  than  having them come to mine (it is a lot easier to leave someone else's office than  it  is  to  get  someone  else  out  of  mine).  I  prefer  catching someone in the hallway or asking him something over the telephone to arranging formal appointments which can take a minimum of five minutes to get twenty seconds' worth of information. In general I find that I pick up 90% of the pertinent information I need in these quick, informal encounters.

I  am  much  more  likely  to  ask  our  executives  for  a  'one  liner'  or 'bulletin' on a particular subject than I am for a formal report. When I am leaving after visiting one of our offices, I will often set aside the final ten or fifteen minutes of the trip for this purpose. I will drop in on several people on my way out either to give them a one liner or ask for  one.  I  find  this  keeps  me  more  current  with  various  situations around the world than almost anything else I do.

These  quick  informal  exchanges  have  a  tendency  to  flow  down through  the  organization  as  a  style  of  communicating.  Employees often adopt the mannerisms and habits of their managers, and one of  the  most  adoptable  of  these  mannerisms  is  the  way  information gets  exchanged.  If  a  manager  is  good  at  exchanging  information quickly, most of the people who work for him will also be good at it. If his style is ponderous or if he tends to restate the obvious or take more time than necessary to say what needs to be said, his whole department will invariably be this way.

A manager's personal style - how good he or she is at exchanging information - contributes more to a department's efficiency than the results of any structured or organizational brilliance.

## To Write Or Not To Write

If  there  is  a  reason  to  write  -  i.e.  to  record  for  future  reference,  to confirm  an  understanding,  to  get  down  a  complex  set  of  facts  or numbers - then write. Even covering yourself or stating your position because you suspect it may be questioned are valid reasons. But if there are no special reasons, ask yourself if verbal communication would not be better, simpler and more efficient.

The most important thing to remember about written communication is that it creates more work than simply your time to write it and someone else's to read it.

Bob Anderson, Chairman of Rockwell International, once told me that  if  an  outside  director  has  something  to  say  to  him,  he  almost always  prefers  to  hear  it  verbally.  With  written  communication  all kinds of possibilities loom and have to be considered. How should it be  responded  to?  What  was  the  sender  really  trying  to  say?  Are there  legal  or  other  implications?  Is  this  a  recommendation  -  or  a threat?

The  same  thing  applies  to  most  written  communication  between departments and executives. Committing words to paper means that certain implications must be considered. It may also mean having to consider implications that are better left unconsidered.

A  good  rule  of  thumb  may  be  to  write  only  under  the circumstances mentioned earlier.

There are a few simple obvious rules that should be followed for internal memoranda:

- 1. Always begin with To:, From:, date and subject.
- 2. Get to the point. A one-line memo has more impact than a twoline memo, etc., etc. Don't circle around the thought or

dramatically build to reach it. There are no literary prizes for the Great Memo.

- 3. Keep it simple. Memos should be used to pass on information, not to discuss it. If it's a complicated issue, some type of interactive communication - a face-to-face discussion or a phone call - is more appropriate. Position or opinion memos can often lead to Memo Wars.
- 4. Hold off sending any sort of controversial memo for twenty-four hours. 'Response memos' (the first salvo of Memo Wars) often fall into this category. One can come back to haunt you even several years after you sent it.
- 5. File memos are helpful. They record details you might otherwise forget. The facts in file memos are given a lot more credibility than the exact same facts recalled weeks, months or years later. And file memos don't demand a response.

There is one final point I want to make about paperwork in general and  memos  in  particular.  I  try  to  write  memos  which  can  be  read once  then  thrown  away.  But  that  is  what  I  do  with  most  of  my incoming mail, whether it's written that way or not.

Next to crossing something off my list, nothing gives me greater pleasure than filing papers in my wastebasket, and I would estimate this  is  the  fate  of  95%  of  my  incoming  paperwork.  Over  the  years, there  have  been  a  number  of  occasions  when  I  have  thrown something away and later really wished I had not. But this, I believe, is  a  small  price  to  pay  for  never  having  to  see  the  rest  of  the paperwork again.

That  reminds  me  of  the  story  about  Lew  Wasserman  and  his famous midnight wastebasket forays at MCA. Perhaps the story is apocryphal, but I've heard it repeated often enough so that even if isn't true it might as well be.

Wasserman would purportedly sweep through the MCA offices in the  late  evening  and  throw  paperwork  he  found  on  anyone's  desk into  the  wastebasket.  The  next  day  the  offended  executives  would be  told,  'If  you  can't  get  it  done  before  you  leave,  it's  not  worth doing.'

This was  obviously  Wasserman's  way  of  making  certain employees aware of  how  they  were  using  their  time,  and  was  not meant to be taken literally. Still, a number of people who have met with me late in the day have joked, 'Mark, you must not be very busy. There isn't a single piece of paper on your desk …'

## Streamline Your Office

I  believe  the  way  an  office  looks  -  how  neat  and  clean  it  is,  how streamlined it is set up - can have a profound effect on how quickly things get done.

When you walk into an office that looks disorganized you start to feel  disorganized.  On  several  occasions  we  have  asked  our  office personnel to keep their desks clean - keeping papers in files if just to hide them - and to eat their lunch in the space provided for it, rather than at their desks.

The frequent response to these requests is that we are being petty and  nitpicky.  Obviously  if  I  felt  this  were  less  important,  I  wouldn't keep insisting on it. But to me the efficiency of an office is directly proportionate to how efficient it looks.

I  have  been  in  offices  that  seem  to  have  been  set  up  by  the Keystone  Kops  -  copying  centres  several  floors  away  from  the departments  that  use  them  most;  typing  pools  set  off  as  separate departments, often on the floor with billing and accounting and other indirect  services;  filing  systems  several  offices  removed  from  the offices they belong to.

These  are  usually  fairly  simple  things  to  correct.  Maybe  if efficiency  experts  spent  more  time  moving  furniture  and  less  time analysing systems, many companies would find they were getting a lot more done.

## For Entrepreneurs Only

One of the most dramatic cultural shifts over the last thirty years has been  a  redefinition  of  The  Great  American  Dream.  People  are  no longer content to work for two cars in the garage and a house in the right  school  district.  Today,  the  enjoyment  of  the  job  itself  may  be even more important than the enjoyment of its tangible rewards.

A lot of people are convinced that they will never achieve total job satisfaction  by  working  for  someone  else.  Given  the  choice  of becoming  chairman  of  their  company  or  owner  of  their  own  small enterprise  they  would  opt  for  the  latter.  Starting  a  business  has become the new Great American Dream.

As  someone  who  started  his  own  business,  I  can  testify  it  is everything  it  is  supposed  to  be.  However,  as  John  Mack  Carter, publisher of Good Housekeeping, once said to me, 'Ninety-nine per cent of the people in the world should be working for somebody.' I tend  to  agree,  which  is  why  the  chapter  on  starting  your  own business comes at the end of this book instead of at the beginning.

If everyone who has talked about starting a business actually went out  and  did  it,  the  whole  nation  would  be  self-employed.  But  most people  would  rather  fantasize  about  it  than  actually  try  to  make  it happen.

The  first  thing  you  have  to  do  is  examine  your  motives,  and  in doing so determine if you are a dreamer or in the 1%.

If you want to be in your own business because you are 'sick and tired of being told what to do', because you want more 'freedom', or because you are unappreciated or undervalued, forget it These are not  reasons  for  starting  a  business;  these  are  reasons  for  running away from your present job. If you want to 'make a lot of money', that's probably not a great reason either. It is a fine and worthwhile

goal, but if it is your prime motivation it is not going to be enough to get you through the lean years.

Before  starting  our  company  I  was  a  lawyer  with  a  prestigious Cleveland firm, but I knew I didn't want to spend the rest of my life practising  corporate  law.  I  loved  negotiating  contracts,  not  drafting them, and the security of the pay cheque wasn't going to be enough to keep me at the firm. I was cautious and apprehensive but I was more  intimidated  by  the  thought  of  wasting  my  time  and  energy building  a  career  I  wouldn't  enjoy.  I  couldn't  afford  not  to  give  this new venture a try.

This, I believe, is at least part of the motivation of most people who successfully start a new business: a feeling that if they never tried they would always regret it. It is what gives you the momentum to get out  the  front  door,  to  cut  the  corporate  umbilical  cord,  and  what makes it possible to keep going, even when everything else makes you  feel  like  turning  back.  Starting  a  business  is  a  financial  and professional commitment. But even more, it is an emotional one.

I  have  a  friend  who,  five  years  ago,  started  what  has  become  a very successful apparel manufacturing firm. He told me recently that if he had known then what the first two years were going to be like, he would have never gone through it.

We  never  had  it  that  rough,  but  I  could  relate  to  what  he  was saying.  There  are  so  many  moments  in  starting  a  new  business when  the  negatives  outweigh  the  positives  that  any  feelings  of satisfaction are very small compensation. There are times when it is the emotional commitment alone that keeps you going.

## Ask Hard Questions

Starting a new business is no time for self-deception, yet it is quite tempting  to  get  caught  up  in  your  own  notes,  business  plans  and prospectus, in the romance of your own words and numbers.

You should be able to 'state your business' clearly and succinctly. Is  it  a  'hard'  idea  (a  new  product  or  one  that  fills  a  clearly  defined void)  or  a  soft  one  (certain  consulting  businesses,  an  already crowded industry, or an idea that isn't all that indistinguishable)? The

danger,  at  the  beginning,  is  that  everything  is  still  fiction,  and  that fiction  can  block  your  ability  to  ask  the  right  questions  and  provide the necessary hard-core answers:

## WHAT ARE THE CONNECTIONS?

How does the idea connect to the market, to the time, and ultimately to the people who will have to buy it? What edge does it have over already existing competition?

I  have seen many new consulting businesses go under because the idea wasn't very good in the first place. In fact, it amazes me how often people think someone will pay for their expertise when theirs is not  an  essential  expertise  to  begin  with  and  when  they  have  no monumental  personal  success  stories  to  convince  potential customers otherwise.

If I were starting IMG today in the same way as I did twenty years ago, I'm  not  all  that  sure  it  would  work,  and  I  am  almost  certain  it would not have worked to the degree that it has. Arnold Palmer was the  right  person  to  represent  at  a  time  when  the  sport  of  golf  was growing by leaps and  bounds.  A  decade  later,  with  our representation  of  Laver,  then  Newcombe  and  then  Borg,  we  were able to repeat this success in tennis, and now, again ten years later, we  are  positioned  to  do  the  same  thing  in  running,  though  no stratospheric superstar has yet emerged in this sport.

In the first two instances, however - golf and tennis - while there is  a  sizeable  core  market,  there  has  been  a  flattening  out  of  the growth curve.

If I were forced to repeat IMG's initial success today, I would have to  wait  for  the  right  combination  of  factors  -  the  connections  -  to come along: an emerging new participant sport; one with seeming whirlwind  growth  potential;  and  a  superstar  who  embodied  the essence of that sport.

## WHY WON'T IT WORK?

What are the immediate problems likely to be encountered? Are they insurmountable, and if they aren't, how do I go about solving them?

WHAT MAKES ME THINK I'M THE ONE TO MAKE IT WORK?

The  new  businesses  that  are  most  likely  to  succeed  are  the  ones that have some relation to what you are already doing for someone else.  In  my  case,  IMG  was  not  so  much  a  new  business  as  an extension of what I was already doing for a law firm.

Several  years  ago,  a  friend  of  mine  started  a  very  successful photo reproduction business, which he later began to franchise. One of his franchisees, whose background was in lithography and design, was in trouble. After meeting with him in an attempt to straighten out the problem, my friend told me, 'Just because our product is twice the quality at half the cost of our competition, he didn't think he had to go out and sell it. When I pointed this out to him, he said, 'Oh, but I'm not a salesman !''

The  dream  of  opening  a  restaurant,  a  frequent  new  business fantasy and a project with one of the highest mortality rates, is an example of why businesses fail because of the wrong aptitudes of their founders.

Restaurateuring  is  a  margin  business  which  demands  shrewd buying  and  a  head  for  numbers.  One  should  also  be  naturally gregarious,  have  a  fondness  for  people,  and  a  willingness  to  work incredibly long hours.

Yet I have known a number of people who talked about opening a restaurant because they wanted 'to do something different' and their sole qualification is that they were good cooks or liked to eat.

## WHAT IS THE 'DOABILITY' QUOTIENT?

We were once presented  with  a  proposal  for  a  World  Air  Race  to coincide with the 1984 Olympics. The initial investment was around $3 million, and it was already partially funded. The concept was quite detailed and well-presented. The only problem was that its execution required the co-operation of half the air forces in the world and an equal number of permissions to use air space.

Needless to say, the 'doability' of this project was absurdly low. A good  idea  requiring  reasonable  expenditures  may  still  be  wrong because it is next to impossible to do, or even if it can be done the time  required  to  execute  it  is  absurdly  high.  Projects  like  this  can have you working for 50 c. an hour.

## Start Small And Keep It Simple

Many new venturists  are  preoccupied  with  all  the  money  they  are going to make, rather than how they are going to go about making it. Set  realistic  goals  by  setting  realistic  steps  -  discreet  'doable' actions,  each  of  which  connects  to  the  next  one  in  some  logical progression.

At some point you have to walk through the wall to get to the other side. But don't just 'do it' until you have a good idea of what you do next. If you can't get 'there' from 'here' in a number of very specific steps, then you probably don't have a business yet.

I am a great believer that the more up-front money a new business requires, the less chance it has of ever getting off the ground.

I'm  prejudiced,  of  course,  having  started  my  own  business  with capitalization of less than $1000. I am also aware there is a whole industry  of  venture  capitalists  who  do  nothing  but  fund  new businesses.  But  the  mere  existence  of  this  industry  has  created  a kind  of  entrepreneurial  myth  -  that  there  are  all  these  people standing  in  line  waiting  for  the  opportunity  to  give  you  money  and that you just haven't met any of them yet.

If and when you do, you will probably find that they aren't as eager to part with their capital as you might have anticipated or, if they are, they will  want  to  extract  a  large  piece  of  the  business  in  return  for their faith.

Many new businesses never get off the ground, not because they were bad ideas, not because the people were wrong, but because the  fund-raising  efforts  failed.  Yet,  many  of  these  new  ventures,  I believe, didn't actually require the capital the participants convinced themselves that they did. If they had been willing to start small, to go back a few steps and start from further back, they could have given themselves a fighting chance.

I can't  over-emphasize  the  importance  of  starting  small  and keeping it  simple.  When I  began, it  would  have  been  very  easy  to convince myself that it simply couldn't be done on any less than a million dollars. How could I represent the top three superstars in the booming sport of golf without a staff of seven or eight and at least a token  presence  in  England  and  Japan?  A  million  dollars,  in  fact,

would  have  been  helpful  and  certainly  convenient.  But  it  wasn't necessary.

Many of the great American success stories emerged from humble beginnings. If you are selling a service, a skill, or an expertise, how much more do you really need than a desk and a phone?

## Be Flexible

Just  as  it  is  essential  to  know  what  business  you're  really  in,  it  is equally important to be aware of what new business you might be in -of new  directions  and  other  opportunities  which  present themselves in the course of your doing business.

If  you  are  tuned  in  and  appropriately  flexible,  you  may  find  that your original business is the tail and the new business it suggests is the  dog.  I  have  an  acquaintance  whose  business  is  lecturing  to corporations  on  effective  writing  techniques.  He  discovered  that many  companies  were  so  impressed  with  his  course  they  were willing to pay whatever he asked to write their corporate brochures for them. This has become a far more lucrative business for him than lecturing.

As I have mentioned, new divisions in our company grew out of our  flexibility  -  the  most  obvious  example  being  our  marketing consulting  division.  We  discovered  in  selling  the  services  of  our clients to various corporations that often our ideas as to how those clients should be used (how to position a particular athlete, what kind of  campaign  to  structure,  etc.)  were  as  valuable  as  the  individual services themselves.

## Share Your Success

In any business, new or otherwise, the idea is to take in more than you spend, but this is most painfully obvious when running a small, new operation.

Pay the people working for you as little as possible and sell them on yourself, on your vision, and on their future and the promise that

as the company grows and becomes successful they will make more than they could ever make elsewhere. I don't think there is anything whatsoever  wrong  with  this  as  long  as  you  keep  your  end  of  the bargain.

If someone working for you makes a substantial contribution to the company,  he  or  she  is  entitled  to  considerably  more  than  the satisfaction of a job well done. In business, one's income acts as a scorecard.  And  while  the  company's  overall  profitability  must  be taken  into  consideration,  that  is  going  to  matter  a  lot  less  to  mat executive than it does to you. Whether such tangible financial proof comes  in  the  form  of  a  raise,  a  bonus  or  additional  perks,  it  is important  that  people  feel  they  are  participating  directly  and commensurately with their contributions to the company.

## Double Your Overhead

Several years ago, I asked a friend who was starting a new business what he anticipated his overhead would be for the first year. He was starting  small,  and  financing  it  himself,  and  he  replied  in  the neighbourhood of $75,000. I told him at the time that he would he advised to double that amount.

People fail to take into account all the hidden costs in starting a new operation. It probably stems from a subconscious overzealousness to make the numbers work (or at least make them palatable).  In  any  case,  it's  easy  to  forget  about  withholding  and social  security  taxes  when  you've  become  accustomed  to  having them  automatically  deducted  from  your  pay  cheque.  Pens  and pencils don't cost much but supplying an office - even a small one for  a  year  adds  up.  Most  businesses  require  some  travel  and entertainment and that gets expensive. Utilities are extremely easy to underestimate. Last year our phone bill alone was over $1 million. Over the years I've discovered that if you double the hard operating expenses  you  originally  budgeted  you'll  end  up  with  a  reasonably accurate projection figure.

Recently I ran into the friend to whom I had given the advice. He told  me  that  at  the  time,  since  I  knew  very  little  about  his  initial

operation - what his rent and personnel were going to cost, etc. - he felt that it had been a fairly arrogant thing for me to say. 'But when I closed the books at the end of the first year,' he said, 'the total was almost exactly $149,000.'

## DOUBLE IT BUT DON'T TRIPLE IT

Many people who want to start a new business, but can never seem to get out the front door, have convinced themselves that it is just a matter of waiting until they have enough money saved up. For these people $10 million would be just short of what they need.

No amount of money in the bank is going to compensate for the loss of security that accompanies the loss of a pay cheque.

In working out your business plan, if you find yourself allowing for the maximum conceivable amount in every expenditure column, your plan will probably never be more than a mental exercise.

## Income First/Organization Later

Several years ago we were setting up a licensing operation for one of  our  clients,  Hank  Ketcham,  the  creator  of  Dennis  the  Menace. Hank is a dear friend and a talented artist but he can sometimes be naive  in  business  matters.  Out  of  the  corporation  we  were organizing,  Hank  was  going  to  be  paying  various  illustrators. Although there were many important logistics to be worked out, Hank was more interested in the profit-sharing plan.

Good  organization  is  essential  to  any  successful  operation.  But there  is  something  nonsensical  about  a  brand-new  corporation sporting an impressive five-year plan before it has even earned its first  dollar.  It's  one  thing  to  know  where  you're  headed  (or  where you'd like to be headed). It's another thing entirely to practise 'cart before the horse' planning.

Prospectuses v. Real Life

I would be quite happy if I never saw another prospectus. The only ones who end up believing them are the people who write them.

The  vast  majority  of  the  prospectuses  I  have  been  shown  or invited to finance reveal a warped time perspective. It's amazing how many  people  forget  to  consider  the  importance  of  cash-flow  in planning their first year. If the first sale is made during the first week of business, very often the proceeds from the sale won't be collected for ninety days, and so on for the second and third sale. The result being,  of  course,  that  the  initial  float  required  for  the  business  is actually a multiple of what's been projected on paper.

It  is  also  amazing  how  blatantly  obvious  people  are  in  padding their  numbers.  Allowing  for  a  reasonable  margin  of  error  in  the numbers is one thing; assuming stupidity on the part of the person reading them is another. I've seen proposals for business ideas that I thought had merit, but which have so turned me off by the projected income and expense numbers that I lost faith in the people doing the proposing. I suspect that these people don't believe in the business themselves and are merely trying to con someone into financing a big expense account.

I  have also seen prospectuses in which I knew the principal had factored in a salary for himself that was more than he was presently making as an employee. I don't think asking someone to finance a $2  million  proposal  is  a  very  effective  or  efficient  way  to  go  about getting  a  $50,000  rise.  I  know  for  sure  I  don't  want  to  be  the  one giving it to him.

## Motion v. Accomplishment

Being  self-employed  is  the  purest  form  of  capitalism  and  the  best way I know of getting paid what you are truly worth. It also demands a  different  mind-set,  including  an  awareness  that  the  number  of hours  you  put  in  is  only  meaningful  in  terms  of  what  you  do  with them.

Most  successful  entrepreneurs  spend  twenty-four  hours  a  day either working or thinking about their business. But it is how they fill those hours that makes the difference between success and failure.

The cliché is, 'Don't work hard, work smart.' The truth is, 'Work hard, work long, and work smart.'

On the positive side, in the beginning, when you are not having to deal with meetings and memos and all the other internal corporate time-takers, you can add, literally, four or five hours to every day. But if  you don't spend them productively, not only will the difference be 'deducted  from  your  pay';  you  might  as  well  spend  them  writing memos to yourself.

## Don't Have Partners

Not enough people examine their motives for taking on partners as carefully  as  they  should.  Often  it  is  a  safety-in-numbers  factor. Naturally, it is comforting to know that the buck doesn't necessarily stop  at  your  desk.  However,  the  problems  of  any  partnership  are likely  to  be  a  lot  greater  than  the  degree  of  security  partnership  is presumed to provide.

Obviously,  there  are  situations  in  which  the  strengths  and weaknesses  of  each  partner  are  well  balanced  and  the  business benefits  from  them.  But  the  odds  are  a  lot  greater  that  the partnership itself will become the business's worst enemy if only by limiting its flexibility.  It  is  probably  not  an accident that some of the greatest entrepreneurial successes have been solo acts.

## Don't Take Equity

Minority  equity  in  a  privately  held  corporation  is,  for  my  money, worthless. Having a 'piece' of someone else's new venture is merely a twenty-four-hour ego trip, but I've always wanted to know exactly what  it  is  they  think  they  have.  With  minority  equity  in  a  sole proprietorship, you cannot read the Wall Street Journal and see what you're  worth;  you  cannot  go  to  the  bank  and  pledge  the  equity against a loan for a new home. You can't even sell the equity easily because such a sale will be restricted by the major shareholder, or

else  you'll  find  that  no  one  will  pay  anything  remotely  resembling what you perceive the equity to be worth.

On  many  occasions  we  have  taken  advantage  of  the misconceptions about minority equity. When our clients are offered equity  in  a  new  venture,  I  always  insist  upon  fees  in  addition  to equity or at least a guaranteed buy back position at any time at the option of our client.

## Fear Of Failure

Fear of failure is at least as common as the desire for success. In fact,  if  properly  harnessed,  it  can  be  the  energy  that  drives  the wheel. But for many people it becomes debilitating.

Learning to use fear rather than letting it use you is obviously not just  a  problem  for  entrepreneurs  but  for  anyone  in  business. Therefore, it seems an appropriate point on which to end the book.

The  French  Olympic  hurdler,  Guy  Drut,  found  himself  in  an unenviable position in the early summer of 1976. He was France's only hope for a track-and-field medal, and the burden of carrying the nation's pride on his shoulders was getting to him. Drut later told me that he had spoken on several occasions prior to the Games with our long-time client Jean-Claude Kiily and that he really felt he owed a part  of  his  gold  medal  to  Killy.  He  explained  it  as  follows:  'JeanClaude told  me  that  I  was  the  only  one  who  knew  how  to  get  my body  and  mind  to  their  ultimate  peak  for  the  Olympic  Games.  He then told me that after I had done this that I should keep saying to myself 'I have done everything I can to get ready for this race and if I win everything will be great, but if I don't win my friends will still be my friends, my enemies will still be my enemies, and the world will still  be  the  same.'  I  repeated  this  sentence  to  myself  before  the qualifying  heats  and  during  the  break  between  the  semifinals  and finals.  I  kept  saying  the  sentence over and over and it blocked out everything else. I was still repeating it to myself when I went up to get my gold medal.'

## Epilogue

When I completed the writing of this book I gave the manuscript to a number of business associates. The response of some of them left me with one nagging concern.

Several  of  them  told  me,  only  half  in  jest,  that  they  enjoyed  the book  'because  I  am  already  doing  most  of  what  you  recommend'. While this was meant to be flattering, I think they were reading the wrong  parts,  and  glossing  over  the  sections  where  their  own business practices could stand some improvement.

The worst thing this book could do is to engender any sort of selfsatisfaction or complacency in those who read it. These are the most sinister forces in business and, alone, are powerful enough to inhibit advancement or career success.

Business  is  a  competition,  and  any  high-level,  sophisticated competition is almost exclusively a head game. The Inner Game of Business,  as  this  could  be  called,  is  understanding  the  Business Paradox: the better you think you are doing, the greater should be your  cause  for  concern;  the  more  self-satisfied  you  are  with  your accomplishments,  your  past  achievements,  your  'right  moves',  the less you should be.

I have long been fascinated, both professionally and psychologically, by what makes a champion. By this I mean the true champions,  the  legends,  the  upper  one  per  cent  who  consistently dominate their opponents, perform at their highest level at the most crucial  times,  and,  in  the  long  term,  distance  themselves  from  the neargreats and the also-rans.

Certainly skills and a supreme confidence in these skills are a part of it, but they are not the determining factors. Most athletes, by the time they reach the professional level, are already blessed with an abundance of both.

The champion's true edge exists solely in the mind, and over the years  I  have  observed  three  attitudinal  characteristics  which  are

common  to  every  superstar  I  have  ever  known.  They  are  just  as applicable  in  business  as  they  are  in  the  athletic  arena.  I  have,  in fact,  adapted  them  to  my  own  business  career  and  they  are  the source from which I derive most of my drive and determination.

The first is the champions' profound sense of dissatisfaction with their own accomplishments. They use any success, any victory, as a spur  to  greater  ambition.  Any  goal  that  is  attained  immediately becomes the next step towards a greater, more 'unreachable' one.

The  second  is  an  ability  to  peak  their  performances,  to  get themselves  up  for  major  tournaments  and  events.  No  one  can operate  consistently  at  his  or  her  highest  level.  Yet  the  legends  of any sports era always seem to perform their best when the stakes are the greatest. This is particularly true in tennis and golf, perhaps the  most  mentally  demanding  of  all  the  major  sports,  and  why  the major  tournaments  in  both  have  always  been  dominated  by  a handful of players.

Finally it is their ability to put their opponents away. This is referred to as 'the killer instinct', but that tells you more about the result than what is going on mentally.

In  the  champion's  mind  he  is  never  ahead.  He  distorts  reality  to serve  his  competitive  purpose.  He  is  always  coming  from  behind, even  when  the  score  indicates  he  is  destroying  his  opponent.  He never believes he is performing as well as he actually is.

I became acutely aware of this a number of years ago when I was in Osaka, Japan with Arnold Palmer and Gary Player, who were in an exhibition match. As they made the turn, I ventured out from the clubhouse to join  them  on  the  ninth  green.  Arnold  was  lining  up  a ten-foot putt for a birdie, and Gary, who had finished the hole, had walked  over  and  was  standing  next  to  me  with  his  arms  folded. Though it was only an exhibition, these two champions were going head-to-head, and I could feel their intensity.

Arnold  sank  his  putt,  and  Gary,  shaking  his  head,  turned  to  me and said, 'He's been doing that all day. I can't buy a putt, and once he gets it on the green it's in the hole.'

I found this remark a bit curious, because in reality Arnold's birdie had brought them dead even. As Arnold walked towards me on his way to the tenth tee, I could see he too was upset. 'Well, what do

you know,' he said, 'I finally made a putt.' Then, motioning ahead to Gary, he added '… and that little son-of-a-bitch can't miss one.' So if this book has left you feeling satisfied with your own business acumen, you may have a lot of catching up to do.

I  would  like  to  thank  John  Boswell  for  having  the  conviction  to believe that what I had to say might be useful to others. Without his advice, support, guidance - and very long hours - the book would never have been written.

Thanks  are  also  due  to  my  editor  Robin  Baird-Smith,  and  Gill Gibbins  at  Collins,  and  to  Judy  Stott,  Julie  Ivelaw-Chapman  and Sarah Wooldridge for coping with the logistics of writing a book from seven points around the globe.
